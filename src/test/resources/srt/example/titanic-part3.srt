495
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:28,975
- We're doing all we can, ma'am.

We neverfound anything onJack.
There's no record of him at all.

00:49:41,915 --> 00:49:45,118
No, there wouldn't be,
would there?

508
00:49:45,185 --> 00:49:48,522
And I've never
spoken of him until now.

Not to anyone,
not even your grandfather.

in everyway
that a person can be saved.

514
00:50:09,576 --> 00:50:12,445
I don't even have
a picture of him.

515
00:50:14,948 --> 00:50:18,819
He exists now only in my memory.
