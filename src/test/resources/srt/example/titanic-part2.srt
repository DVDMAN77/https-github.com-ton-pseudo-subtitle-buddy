ln fact, I put in these new type davits

which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one

00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:05,797
but it was thought by some
that the deckwould looktoo cluttered

00:13:23,308 --> 00:13:27,445
I can't turn away
without knowingyou'll be all right.

157
00:13:27,512 --> 00:13:30,114
That's all that I want.

158
00:13:30,181 --> 00:13:32,617
Well, I'm fine.

159
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:35,820
I'll be fine, really.

160
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:38,289
Really?

161
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:44,395
I don't think so.
They've gotyou trapped, Rose

162
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:46,264
and you're going to die
ifyou don't breakfree--

163
00:13:46,331 --> 00:13:49,901
Maybe not right away
becauseyou're strong, but

164
00:13:49,968 --> 00:13:53,571
sooner or laterthat fire
that I love aboutyou, Rose...

165
00:13:53,638 --> 00:13:56,374
that fire is going to burn out.

166
00:14:00,979 --> 00:14:03,047
It's not up toyou
to save me,Jack.

167
00:14:05,216 --> 00:14:09,621
You're right.
Onlyyou can do that.

168
00:14:15,693 --> 00:14:18,897
I'm going back.
Leave me alone.

169
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:33,578
Countess: Tell Lucille about the
disasteryou had with the stationer's.

170
00:14:33,645 --> 00:14:36,748
Well, ofcourse, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.

171
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:39,817
- Oh, my dear!
- And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--

172
00:14:39,884 --> 00:14:42,187
Let me tell you what an odyssey
that has been.

173
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:45,623
Rose decided
she wanted lavender.

174
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,560
She knows I detest the color,
so she did it onlyto spite me.

175
00:14:48,626 --> 00:14:50,962
Lucille:
lfonlyyou'd come to me sooner.

176
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,998
Ruth saw some of my designs
in "La Mode Illustree."

177
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:57,468
Theywere forTrousseau ofthe Duchess
of Malborough'syoungest daughter.

178
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:00,872
Theywere quite charming, but I think
you'll agree, my dear, that together

179
00:15:00,939 --> 00:15:03,208
we've created something ofa phoenix
from the ashes.

180
00:15:03,274 --> 00:15:05,210
( Women Laugh Politely)

181
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,658
Hello,Jack.

182
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,498
I changed my mind.

183
00:15:32,704 --> 00:15:34,672
- They said you might be--
- Shh.

184
00:15:36,307 --> 00:15:38,977
Give meyour hand.

185
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:49,120
Now closeyour eyes.

186
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:51,122
Go on.

187
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,693
Step up.

188
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,665
Now hold on to the railing.

189
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:03,835
- Keepyour eyes closed, don't peek.
- I'm not.

190
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,705
Step up onto the rail.

191
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:14,579
Hold on. Hold on.
Keepyour eyes closed.

192
00:16:14,646 --> 00:16:17,682
- ( Giggles)
- Doyou trust me?

193
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:19,984
I trustyou.

194
00:16:28,826 --> 00:16:32,463
All right, open your eyes.

195
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,240
I'm flying!Jack!

196
00:17:05,563 --> 00:17:09,901
( Softly):
" Come,Josephine, myflying machine "

197
00:17:09,968 --> 00:17:12,837
" Going up, she goes "

198
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:15,773
" Up, she goes... "

199
00:18:02,487 --> 00:18:05,690
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

200
00:18:05,757 --> 00:18:09,861
So we're up to dusk
the night ofthe sinking.

201
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:12,430
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.

202
00:18:12,497 --> 00:18:15,099
There's Smith and he's standing there
and he's got the iceberg warning...

203
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:19,571
in his fucking hand-- excuse me--
his hand, and he's ordering more speed.

204
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:22,473
26years ofexperience
working against him.

205
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,043
He figures anything big enough
to sinkthe ship

206
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:27,278
they're going to see
in time to turn

207
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:30,215
but the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

208
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:32,984
Doesn't cornerworth a damn.

209
00:18:33,051 --> 00:18:35,987
Everything he knows is wrong.

210
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,301
( Laughing)
It's quite proper, I assureyou.

211
00:18:50,368 --> 00:18:53,771
This is the sitting room.

212
00:18:53,838 --> 00:18:55,940
- Will this light do?
- What?

213
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:58,176
Don't artists need good light?

214
00:18:58,243 --> 00:19:00,178
( ln French Accent):
That is true

215
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:03,047
but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

216
00:19:03,114 --> 00:19:05,884
Monet!

217
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,053
- Doyou know his work?
- Ofcourse.

218
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,289
Look at his use ofcolor here.
Isn't he great?

219
00:19:11,356 --> 00:19:13,291
I know, it's extraordinary.

220
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:19,564
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

221
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:22,901
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

222
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:26,938
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

223
00:19:28,706 --> 00:19:33,344
- That's nice.
- What is it, a sapphire?

224
00:19:33,411 --> 00:19:37,081
A diamond,
a very rare diamond.

225
00:19:40,485 --> 00:19:46,090
Jack, I wantyou to draw me like one
ofyour French girls... wearing this.

226
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:48,993
All right.

227
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,262
Wearing onlythis.

228
00:20:25,697 --> 00:20:28,700
The last thing I need
is another picture of me

229
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:31,569
Iooking like a porcelain doll.

230
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:36,374
As a paying customer...

231
00:20:38,443 --> 00:20:41,379
I expect to get what I want.

232
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:00,932
Over on the bed--
the couch.

233
00:21:09,307 --> 00:21:11,009
Go... Iie down.

234
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:18,249
- Tell me when it looks right.
- Putyour arm backthe way it was.

235
00:21:18,316 --> 00:21:20,251
Right.

236
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:24,155
Put that other arm up,
that hand right byyourface there.

237
00:21:25,323 --> 00:21:27,392
Right.

238
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:29,994
Now, head down.

239
00:21:32,297 --> 00:21:34,232
Eyes to me,
keep them on me.

240
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,269
And tryto stay still.

241
00:21:40,972 --> 00:21:42,907
( Exhales)

242
00:21:56,621 --> 00:21:59,057
So serious.

243
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:44,169
I believeyou are blushing,
Mr. Big Artiste.

244
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:51,109
I can't imagine
Monsieur Monet blushing.

245
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:55,513
He does landscapes.
Just relaxyourface.

246
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,183
- Sorry.
- No laughing.

247

( Exhales)

248
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:32,517
My heart was pounding
the whole time.

249
00:23:32,584 --> 00:23:36,554
It was the most erotic moment
of my life.

250
00:23:40,091 --> 00:23:42,861
Up until then, at least.

251
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:48,533
- So what happened next?
- You mean, did we do it?

252
00:23:50,735 --> 00:23:53,171
Sorry, to disappointyou,
Mr. Bodine.

253

Whatyou doing?

257
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,395
Will you put this back
in the safe for me?

258
00:24:17,462 --> 00:24:19,397
Mm-hmm.

259
00:24:29,908 --> 00:24:32,310
Would you excuse me?

260
00:24:34,245 --> 00:24:38,917
- None ofthe stewards have seen her.
- This is absurd.

261
00:24:38,983 --> 00:24:42,287
It's a ship, there's only
so many places she could be.

262
00:24:42,353 --> 00:24:44,289
Lovejoy, find her.

- Clear.
- Yes.

264
00:25:04,375 --> 00:25:08,580
I don't think I've ever seen
such a flat calm.

265
00:25:08,646 --> 00:25:13,251
Like a mill pond.
Not a breath ofwind.

266
00:25:13,318 --> 00:25:16,754
It will make the bergs
harderto see

with no breaking water
at the base.

and heading, Mr. Lightoller.

doing down here?

It's easy enough for a professional.

This is absurd.

your clothes back on, dear.

- When can we get underway, damn it?

That's five compartments.

She can stay afloat with the first

But this ship can't sink.

Listen, Rose,you're going to have
to find a spare key, all right?

00:56:21,319 --> 00:56:23,988
Look in that cabinet
right there.

It's a little
silver one, Rose.
