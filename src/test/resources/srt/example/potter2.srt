1
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,031
Cool.

2
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,159
Is it dead?

3
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,114
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

4
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,350
Troll boogers.

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,150
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,797
-Well, what it is--
-It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

7
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,029
Miss Granger?

8
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:09,749
I went looking for the troll.
I thought I could handle it.

9
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,757
But I was wrong.

10
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,795
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,992
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,638
I expected more rational behavior
and am very disappointed in you.

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,718
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,356
...for your serious lack of judgment.

15
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,711
As for you two gentlemen...

16
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,196
... I just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

17
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,676
Not many first-year students
could take on a troll...

18
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,394
...and live to tell the tale.

19
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,949
Five points...

20
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,272
...will be awarded to each of you...

21
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,758
...for sheer dumb luck.

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,715
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,839
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

24
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,112
Ron's right.
You'll need your strength today.

25
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,436
I'm not hungry.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,393
Good luck today, Potter.
You've proven yourself against a troll.

27
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,637
A game of Quidditch
should be easy work.

28
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,832
Even if it is against Slytherin.

29
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,476
-That explains the blood.
-Blood?

30
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,839
Last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

31
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,600
...so he could get past that dog.

32
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,439
But he got bit,
that's why he's limping.

33
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,796
But why would anyone go near that dog?

34
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,557
At Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of the vault.

35
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,877
Said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

36
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,149
You're saying--

37
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,672
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,068
-Bit early for mail, isn't it?
-But I never get mail.

39
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,079
Let's open it.

40
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,034
It's a broomstick.

41
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,759
That's not just a broomstick,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

42
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,116
But who--?

43
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,269
-Scared, Harry?
-A little.

44
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,995
It's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

45
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,556
-What happened?
-I don't really remember.

46
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,400
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

47
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,319
Woke up in hospital a week later.

48
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,831
Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

49
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,556
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

50
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,955
The players take their positions...

51
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:28,789
...as Madam Hooch steps onto
the field to begin the game!

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,197
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

53
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,109
...from all of you!

54
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,838
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

55
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,634
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

56
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:49,469
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

57
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,319
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

58
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,836
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

59
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,028
Well done!

60
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,712
Slytherin takes the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

61
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,113
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

62
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,157
Give me that!

63
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,834
Take that side!

64
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,397
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

65
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,076
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

66
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,478
-Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
-Leave it to me.

67
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,839
Come on, Hermione!

68
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,955
Lacarnum Inflamarae.

69
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,672
Fire! You' re on fire!

70
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,870
Go, go, go, go!

71
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,990
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

72
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,439
He's got the Snitch!

73
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,553
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

74
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,352
Gryffindor wins!

75
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:59,233
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

76
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,194
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog?

77
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,709
-Who told you about Fluffy?
-Fluffy?

78
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,435
-That thing has a name?
-Of course he has a name. He's mine.

79
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:14,714
I bought him off an Irishman.
I lent him to Dumbledore to guard--

80
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,311
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions! That's top-secret.

81
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,714
But whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

82
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,230
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

83
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,589
Teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

84
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,236
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

85
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,590
Exactly.

86
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,879
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

87
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,551
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

88
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,629
What that dog is guarding is
between Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

89
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,193
Nicholas Flamel?

90
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,676
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

91
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,793
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

92
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,911
I don't know.

93
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,719
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

94
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,633
Ring the Hogwart bell

95
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,513
Merry Christmas
Merry Christmas

96
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,518
Cast a Christmas spell

97
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,757
Knight to e5.

98
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,190
Queen to e5.

99
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,953
That's totally barbaric!

100
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,950
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

101
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,559
I see you haven't.

102
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,835
Change of plans. My parents went
to Romania to visit my brother Charlie.

103
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,715
-He's studying dragons there.
-Good. You can help Harry.

104
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,151
He's going to the library
to look up Nicholas Flamel.

105
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,716
We've looked a hundred times!

106
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,348
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

107
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,278
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

108
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,872
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

109
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,517
-Happy Christmas, Harry.
-Happy Christmas, Ron.

110
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,836
What are you wearing?

111
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,949
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

112
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,349
-I've got presents?
-Yeah.

113
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,471
There they are.

114
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,396
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

115
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,599
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well. "

116
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,269
-What is it?
-Some kind of cloak.

117
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,358
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

118
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,788
My body's gone!

119
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,436
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

120
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,791
I'm invisible?

121
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,472
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

122
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,516
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

123
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,072
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

124
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,877
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

125
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,751
Who's there?

126
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,033
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

127
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,715
Who is it? Show yourself.

128
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,279
Severus, I....

129
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,629
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

130
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,356
-I don't know what you mean.
-You know perfectly well what I mean.

131
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,952
We'll have another little chat soon.

132
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,393
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

133
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,872
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

134
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,235
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

135
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,312
Mum?

136
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,351
Dad?

137
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:24,435
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

138
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,953
Ron, come on, get out of bed!

139
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:32,596
-Why?
-There's something you've got to see!

140
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,158
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

141
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,437
I only see us.

142
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,877
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

143
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,757
-There. You see them, don't you?
-That's me! Only I'm head boy.

144
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,470
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

145
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,713
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

146
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,155
I look good.

147
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,435
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

148
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,395
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

149
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,670
Back again, Harry?

150
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,029
I see that you,
like many before you...

151
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,233
... have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

152
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,553
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

153
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,234
Let me give you a clue.

154
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,796
The happiest man on earth...

155
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,231
...would look in the mirror
and see only himself...

156
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,670
...exactly as he is.

157
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:10,715
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

158
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,559
Yes. And no.

159
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,915
It shows us nothing more or less...

160
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,831
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

161
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:27,556
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

162
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,469
...you see them standing beside you.

163
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,989
But remember this, Harry.

164
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,872
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

165
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,116
...or truth.

166
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:48,831
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

167
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,799
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

168
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,831
And I must ask you...

169
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,469
... not to go looking for it again.

170
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,192
It does not do to dwell on dreams...

171
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,513
...and forget to live.

172
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,438
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

173
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,638
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

174
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,751
This is light?

175
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,469
Of course! Here it is!

176
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,514
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

177
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,875
The what?

178
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,398
Honestly, don't you two read?

179
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,912
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

180
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,634
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

181
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,674
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

182
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,950
-Immortal?
-It means you'll never die.

183
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,151
I know what it means!

184
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,516
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

185
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:52,669
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday. "

186
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,390
That's what Fluffy's guarding.

187
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,116
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

188
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,829
Don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no state to entertain.

189
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,634
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

190
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,075
-We think Snape's trying to steal it.
-Are you still on about him?

191
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,953
We know he's after it.
We don't know why.

192
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,313
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He won't steal it.

193
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,595
What?

194
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,036
You heard. Come on,
I' m a bit preoccupied today.

195
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,800
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

196
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,709
There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

197
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,434
-Spells, enchantments.
-Right.

198
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,592
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

199
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,791
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

200
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,515
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

201
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:07,196
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

202
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,349
-Hagrid, what exactly is that?
-That? It's....

203
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,511
I know what that is!

204
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,234
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

205
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,717
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

206
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,833
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

207
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,276
Is that...

208
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,155
...a dragon?

209
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,592
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

210
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,553
My brother works
with these in Romania.

211
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,436
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

212
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,752
Hello, Norbert.

213
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,198
-Norbert?
-He's gotta have a name, don't he?

214
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:25,275
Don't you, Norbert?

215
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,952
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

216
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,671
Who's that?

217
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,311
Malfoy.

218
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,393
Oh, dear.

219
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,636
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
Told me so the first time I met him.

220
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:56,719
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

221
00:28:56,920 --> 00:29:00,833
-I don't understand. Is that bad?
-It's bad.

222
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,190
Good evening.

223
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,478
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

224
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,076
...gives a student the right
to walk about at night.

225
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,956
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

226
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,390
-50?!
-Each.

227
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,675
To ensure it doesn't happen again...

228
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,077
...all four of you
will receive detention.

229
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,793
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

230
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,230
I thought you said the four of us.

231
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,829
No, you heard me correctly.

232
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:40,830
Honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

233
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,113
You will join your classmates
in detention.

234
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,714
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

235
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,436
Was a time detention found you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

236
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,359
God, I miss the screaming.

237
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:11,951
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

238
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:17,280
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

239
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,113
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

240
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,310
Good God, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

241
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,471
Norbert's gone.

242
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,390
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

243
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,797
That's good, isn't it?
He's with his own kind.

244
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,190
What if he don't like Romania?

245
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,473
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby.

246
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:52,108
For God's sake, pull yourself together.
You're going into the Forest.

247
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,595
Got to have your wits about you.

248
00:30:54,800 --> 00:31:00,238
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

249
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,355
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

250
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,034
...werewolves.

251
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,591
There's more than werewolves
in those trees.

252
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,360
You can be sure of that.

253
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,593
Nighty-night.

254
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,799
Right. Let's go.

255
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,749
Hagrid, what is that?

256
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:04,191
What we're here for.
See that?

257
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,834
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

258
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,751
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

259
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,478
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

260
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,672
Ron, Hermione, come with me.

261
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,271
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

262
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,675
Okay. Then I get Fang.

263
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:43,358
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

264
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,670
Wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

265
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,634
If I didn't know better,
I'd say you were scared.

266
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,308
I'm not scared, Potter.

267
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,277
Do you hear that?

268
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,073
Come on, Fang.

269
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,713
Scared!

270
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,750
What is it, Fang?

271
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:45,519
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

272
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:49,554
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

273
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,399
What was that thing you saved me from?

274
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,720
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

275
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,233
Drinking its blood will keep you alive
even if you are an inch from death.

276
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,309
But at a terrible price. For you
have slain something so pure...

277
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:13,150
...that the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

278
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,078
A cursed life.

279
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,068
-Who would choose such a life?
-Can you think of no one?

280
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,035
Do you mean to say that
that thing that killed the unicorn...

281
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,114
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

282
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,269
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment?

283
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,559
The Philosopher's Stone.

284
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,751
Harry!

285
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,632
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

286
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,910
You all right there, Harry?

287
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,118
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

288
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,635
You' re safe now. Good luck.

289
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,919
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

290
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:09,793
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

291
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,798
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

292
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,198
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants it for Voldemort.

293
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,757
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

294
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,473
He'll come back.

295
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,352
But if he comes back...

296
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,388
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

297
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,750
If he'd had the chance,
he might have tried tonight.

298
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,396
And to think I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

299
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,036
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

300
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,076
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

301
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,715
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

302
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,799
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

303
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:06,519
I'd heard Hogwarts' final exams were
frightful, but I found that enjoyable.

304
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,235
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

305
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:15,389
-My scar. It keeps burning.
-It's happened before.

306
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,160
-Not like this.
-You should see the nurse.

307
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,716
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

308
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,395
-Of course!
-What is it?

309
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,195
Isn't it odd that what Hagrid wants
more than anything is a dragon...

310
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,358
...and a stranger just happens
to have one?

311
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,120
How many people wander around
with dragon eggs?

312
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,470
Why didn't I see it before?

313
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,196
Who gave you the egg?
What did he look like?

314
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,039
I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

315
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,708
You and this stranger
must have talked.

316
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,670
He wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

317
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,714
I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem. "

318
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:10,198
-Was he interested in Fluffy?
-Of course he was interested.

319
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:14,593
How often do you come across
a three-headed dog?

320
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:20,193
But I told him, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

321
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,633
Take Fluffy, for example. Play him
music and he falls straight to sleep.

322
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,794
I shouldn't have told you that.

323
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,156
Where are you going?

324
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,519
We have to see Dumbledore.
Immediately!

325
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,474
I'm afraid he's not here.

326
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,798
He received an urgent owl
from the Ministry of Magic and left.

327
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,634
He's gone?
But this is important!

328
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,996
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

329
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,389
-How do you know--?
-Someone's going to try and steal it.

330
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,994
I don't know how you know,
but I assure you it is well protected.

331
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,318
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

332
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,953
That was no stranger Hagrid met.
It was Snape.

333
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,720
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

334
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,629
-And with Dumbledore gone--
-Good afternoon.

335
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,558
What would three young Gryffindors...

336
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,918
... be doing inside on a day like this?

337
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,870
-We were just--
-You ought to be careful.

338
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,277
People will think you' re...

339
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,994
... up to something.

340
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,791
Now what do we do?

341
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,595
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

342
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,199
Trevor.

343
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,796
Trevor, go! You shouldn't be here!

344
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,239
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

345
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,228
-Neville, listen. We were--
-No, I won't let you!

346
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,871
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

347
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,198
Neville, I'm really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

348
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,469
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

349
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:00,190
Brilliant, but scary.

350
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,796
Let's go.

351
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,073
-Sorry.
-It's for your own good, you know.

352
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:16,068
-You stood on my foot!
-Sorry.

353
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,756
Alohomora.

354
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,748
Wait a minute. He's...

355
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,990
...snoring.

356
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:46,713
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

357
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,118
It's got horrible breath.

358
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,591
-We have to move its paw.
-What?

359
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,153
Come on!

360
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,031
Okay. Push.

361
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,710
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

362
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:33,710
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

363
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,790
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

364
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,232
The harp.

365
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,474
It's stopped playing.

366
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,189
Jump!

367
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,270
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

368
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:28,078
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

369
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,829
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

370
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:36,830
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

371
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,274
Hermione!

372
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:44,469
-Now what are we gonna do?
-Just relax!

373
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:48,992
-Hermione, where are you?
-Do what I say! Trust me.

374
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,997
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

375
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,112
-He's not relaxing, is he?
-Apparently not.

376
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,754
-We've gotta do something.
-What?

377
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,758
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

378
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:12,275
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

379
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,678
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! It hates sunlight.

380
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,876
Lumus Solem.

381
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,108
-Ron, you okay?
-Yeah.

382
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,075
Lucky we didn't panic.

383
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,156
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

384
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,153
What is that?

385
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:44,909
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

386
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,830
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

387
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:04,510
They're not birds.
They're keys.

388
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:08,030
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

389
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,797
-What's this all about?
-I don't know.

390
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:23,396
Strange.

391
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,995
Alohomora!

392
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,990
Well, it was worth a try.

393
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,317
What will we do?
There must be a thousand keys.

394
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:38,274
We want a big, old-fashioned one.
Probably rusty.

395
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:41,756
I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

396
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,430
What's wrong?

397
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,713
It's too simple.

398
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:54,471
Go on! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

399
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:58,070
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

400
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,118
This complicates things a bit.

401
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,351
Catch the key!

402
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,431
Hurry up!

403
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:21,071
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

404
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,317
Where are we? A graveyard.

405
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,194
This is no graveyard.

406
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,198
It's a chessboard.

407
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:50,511
There's the door.

408
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,513
Now what do we do?

409
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,839
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

410
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,995
Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

411
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,359
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

412
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,479
As for me, I'll be a knight.

413
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,998
What happens now?

414
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,638
Well, white moves first.

415
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,637
And then...

416
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,514
...we play.

417
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,515
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

418
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,150
...real wizard's chess, do you?

419
00:48:56,520 --> 00:48:59,353
You there, d5.

420
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:14,873
Yes, Hermione.

421
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:19,949
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

422
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,029
Castle to e4!

423
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,715
Pawn to c3!

424
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,354
-Wait a minute.
-You understand right, Harry.

425
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:25,116
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

426
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,950
Then you're free to check the king.

427
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,754
-No. Ron, no!
-What is it?

428
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:35,831
-He's going to sacrifice himself.
-No, there must be another way!

429
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,635
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

430
00:50:39,840 --> 00:50:43,276
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

431
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,399
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

432
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:59,038
Knight to h3.

433
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:21,031
Check.

434
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,718
Ron!

435
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,472
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

436
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,148
Checkmate.

437
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,669
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

438
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,589
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

439
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,597
I have to go on.

440
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,757
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

441
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:48,349
Not as good as you.

442
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:53,790
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

443
00:52:54,960 --> 00:53:00,353
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

444
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,472
You?

445
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,915
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the--

446
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,032
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

447
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:49,232
Next to him, who would suspect...

448
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:53,194
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

449
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,554
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

450
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:01,433
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

451
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,913
If Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

452
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:08,236
... I would have succeeded.

453
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,318
Even with Snape muttering
his countercurse.

454
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,636
Snape was trying to save me?

455
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:18,960
I knew you were a danger to me,
especially after Halloween.

456
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:23,233
-Then you let the troll in!
-Very good, Potter, yes.

457
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,318
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

458
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:31,635
While everyone ran about,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

459
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:35,876
He, of course, never trusted me again.

460
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,868
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

461
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:45,959
I' m never alone. Never.

462
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,073
Now, what does this mirror do?

463
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,636
I see what I desire.

464
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,392
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

465
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:00,670
Use the boy.

466
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,194
Come here, Potter! Now!

467
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:20,634
Tell me, what do you see?

468
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,069
What is it? What do you see?

469
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,229
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

470
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,919
He lies.

471
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,949
Tell the truth! What do you see?

472
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:02,358
-Let me speak to him.
-Master, you are not strong enough.

473
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,434
I have strength enough for this.

474
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,633
Harry Potter...

475
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,070
...we meet again.

476
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,633
Voldemort.

477
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:34,628
Yes. You see what I've become?

478
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,316
See what I must do to survive?

479
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:42,479
Live off another. A mere parasite.

480
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,317
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

481
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,035
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

482
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,630
But there is something that can.

483
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:59,278
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

484
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,119
Stop him!

485
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,599
Don't be a fool.

486
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,072
Why suffer an horrific death...

487
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:15,750
...when you can join me and live?

488
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:16,995
Never!

489
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,516
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

490
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,391
Tell me, Harry...

491
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:31,349
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

492
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,591
Together...

493
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,234
...we can bring them back.

494
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:41,156
All I ask is for something in return.

495
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:50,592
That's it, Harry.

496
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,149
There is no good and evil.

497
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,238
There is only power...

498
00:57:58,440 --> 00:58:02,399
...and those too weak to seek it.

499
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:07,875
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

500
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,430
Just give me the Stone!

501
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,075
You liar!

502
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,316
Kill him!

503
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:44,000
-What is this magic?
-Fool, get the Stone!

504
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,349
Good afternoon, Harry.

505
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,712
-Tokens from your admirers?
-Admirers?

506
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,677
What happened in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a secret.

507
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,476
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

508
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:50,190
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

509
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:53,119
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

510
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,198
Ron was here? Is he all right?
What about Hermione?

511
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,076
Fine. They're both just fine.

512
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:04,313
-What happened to the Stone?
-Relax, dear boy.

513
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,359
The Stone has been destroyed.

514
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,639
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

515
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,628
...and agreed it was best all around.

516
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:19,515
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

517
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:26,759
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

518
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:30,032
But yes, he will die.

519
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:32,595
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

520
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,234
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and--

521
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,353
You see, only a person...

522
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,394
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

523
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:47,997
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

524
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,276
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

525
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,315
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

526
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,714
Does that mean, with the Stone gone,
that Voldemort can never come back?

527
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,150
I'm afraid...

528
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:11,399
...there are ways
in which he can return.

529
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:14,548
Harry, do you know why...

530
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:18,594
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

531
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:23,237
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

532
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,832
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

533
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,669
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

534
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:35,590
-It lives in your very skin.
-What is it?

535
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,995
Love, Harry. Love.

536
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,679
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

537
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:56,351
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

538
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,751
And since then,
I've lost my liking for them.

539
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,191
But I think I could be safe...

540
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,675
...with a nice toffee.

541
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:11,079
Alas!

542
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,796
Earwax.

543
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,437
-All right there, Ron?
-All right. You?

544
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:35,114
All right. Hermione?

545
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:37,512
Never better.

546
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,035
Another year gone.

547
01:03:55,760 --> 01:04:00,117
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

548
01:04:00,320 --> 01:04:02,834
And the points stand thus:

549
01:04:03,040 --> 01:04:08,592
In fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

550
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,918
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

551
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:22,718
In second place...

552
01:04:22,920 --> 01:04:27,516
... Ravenclaw with 426 points.

553
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:34,598
And in first place...

554
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:40,119
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

555
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,596
Nice one, mate.

556
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,193
Yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done.

557
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:59,558
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

558
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,515
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

559
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:10,399
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

560
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:13,273
...while others were in grave peril...

561
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:16,110
...50 points.

562
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,228
Good job.

563
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:31,431
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

564
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,948
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

565
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,356
And third...

566
01:05:43,880 --> 01:05:46,633
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

567
01:05:46,840 --> 01:05:50,958
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

568
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:56,196
...I award Gryffindor house 60 points.

569
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:05,991
We' re tied with Slytherin!

570
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:11,957
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

571
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:15,869
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

572
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:18,913
I award 10 points...

573
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:22,192
...to Neville Longbottom.

574
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:38,276
Assuming that my calculations
are correct...

575
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:42,837
...I believe that a change
of decoration is in order.

576
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,911
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

577
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,597
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

578
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:34,918
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

579
01:07:40,120 --> 01:07:43,271
-Come on, Harry.
-One minute.

580
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,875
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

581
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,712
This is for you.

582
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:15,836
Thanks, Hagrid.

583
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:25,672
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

584
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:30,358
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

585
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:33,160
...you could always threaten him...

586
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,113
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with his tail.

587
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:41,189
But we' re not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

588
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:45,792
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

589
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:54,072
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

590
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:56,271
I'm not going home.

591
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,311
Not really.

592
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:25,669
