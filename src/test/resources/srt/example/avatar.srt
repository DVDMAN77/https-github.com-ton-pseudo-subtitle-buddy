1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,000
<i>Sooner or later though,
you always have to wake up.</i>

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,685
<i>In cryo you don't dream at all.</i>

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,460
<i>Doesn't feel like 6 years.</i>

4
00:00:22,495 --> 00:00:25,900
<i>More like after tequila
and ass kicking.</i>

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,685
<i>Tommy was the scientist, not me.</i>

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,200
<i>He was the one who wanted to get shot light
years out in space to find the answers.</i>

7
00:00:39,235 --> 00:00:40,965
Are we there yet?

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,720
Yeah, we're there sunshine.

9
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,520
<i>It's about your brother.</i>

10
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,960
<i>A week before Tommy's
gonna ship out...</i>

11
00:00:52,995 --> 00:00:55,520
<i>A guy with a gun ends his journey.</i>

12
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,965
<i>For the paper in his wallet.</i>

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,080
Being in cryo for 5 years,
9 months and 22 days.

14
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:05,120
You will be hungry,
you will be weak.

15
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:07,765
If you feel noxious...

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,965
<i>Tommy was the scientist.</i>

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,680
<i>I'm just another dumb grunt going
some place he's gonna regret.</i>

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,800
<i>Up ahead was Pandora.</i>

19
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,200
<i>I grew up hearing about it,
but I never figured I'd be going there.</i>

20
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,965
Your brother represented
a significant investment.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
We'd like to talk to you
about taking over his contract.

22
00:01:51,035 --> 00:01:53,600
And since your genome is identical to his,

23
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:56,200
you could step into his shoes.

24
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,000
So to speak.

25
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,720
<i>It'd be a fresh start,
on a new world.</i>

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
And the pay is good.

27
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,400
Very good.

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,965
Egzo packs on!

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Remember people, you loose that mask
you're unconscious in 20 seconds.

30
00:02:48,035 --> 00:02:51,200
You're dead in 4 minutes.
Let nobody be dead today,

31
00:02:51,235 --> 00:02:54,600
looks very bad on my report.

32
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,680
<i>One life ends...</i>

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,000
<i>Another begins.</i>

34
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:58,720
When the ramp comes down
go directly into the base, do not stop!

35
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:02,000
Go straight inside!
Wait for my mark!

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,920
Go!

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,365
<i>There's no such thing
as an ex marine.</i>

38
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,885
<i>You may be out, but you
never loose the attitude.</i>

39
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,080
<i>I told myself I could pass
any test a man can pass.</i>

40
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,565
<i>They can fix the spine,
if you got the money.</i>

41
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,400
<i>But not on dead benefits,
not in this economy.</i>

42
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,480
Let's go special case,
do not make me wait for you.

43
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,000
Well well ladies.

44
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,400
Look at all this fresh meat.

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,280
<i>Back on Earth, these guys
were army dogs, marines.</i>

46
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,200
<i>Fighting for freedom.</i>

47
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,280
<i>Look out hot rod.</i>

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,880
<i>But out here they're just hired guns,
taking the money, working for the company.</i>

49
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:17,520
Check this out man.
Meals on wheels.

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
Man, that is just wrong.

51
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:37,000
You are not in Kansas any more.

52
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,965
You are on Pandora,
ladies and gentlemen.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,480
Respect that fact,
every second of every day.

54
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,565
If there is a hell,

55
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,920
you might wanna go there for some
R and R after a tour on Pandora.

56
00:05:55,955 --> 00:06:01,280
Out there beyond that fence,
every living thing that

57
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,720
crawls, flies or squats in the mud wants to
kill you and eat your eyes for joo-joo-bees.

58
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,480
We have an indigenous population
of humanoids called the Na'vi.

59
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:15,100
They're fond of arrows
dipped in a neuro toxin

60
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:17,680
that will stop your heart in one minute.

61
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,000
And they have bones reinforced
with naturally occuring carbon fiber.

62
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,165
They are very hard to kill.

63
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,480
As head of security,
it is my job to keep you alive.

64
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:35,280
I will not succeed.

65
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,365
Not with all of you.

66
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,000
If you wish to survive you need to
cultivate a strong mental attitude.

67
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:47,200
You've got to obey the rules.

68
00:06:47,235 --> 00:06:50,080
Pandora rules.

69
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,365
Rule number one...

70
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,720
It's nothing like an old school safety
brief to put your mind at ease.

71
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,400
Jake, you're Jake right?

72
00:07:02,435 --> 00:07:04,817
Tom's brother.

73
00:07:04,852 --> 00:07:07,165
You look just like him.

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm Norm Spellman, went through
avatar training with him.

75
00:07:11,555 --> 00:07:15,000
The bio lab, we're gonna
spend a lot of time here.

76
00:07:15,035 --> 00:07:18,965
How you doing,
Norm, avatar driver.

77
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Here's the link room, this is where we're
connecting to the avatar...

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,320
Me and Norm here, are to drive these
remotely controlled bodies called avatars.

79
00:07:30,355 --> 00:07:35,400
They're grown from human DNA
mixed with the DNA of the natives.

80
00:07:35,435 --> 00:07:37,365
Welcome.

81
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,320
Welcome to Pandora,
good to have you.

82
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,800
They got big. - They fully
mature on the flight out.

83
00:07:45,835 --> 00:07:49,000
So the progress up the stim
seem to work really well.

84
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:50,965
Yeah, they got great muscle tone.

85
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It'll take us a few hours
to get them prepared,

86
00:07:53,001 --> 00:07:55,000
but you can take them out tomorrow.

87
00:07:55,035 --> 00:07:57,800
There's yours.

88
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,280
Looks like him.

89
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,285
Looks like you.

90
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,680
This is your avatar now, Jake.

91
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,920
The concept is that every driver
is matched to his own avatar.

92
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:45,800
So that their nervous system are in tuned.

93
00:08:45,835 --> 00:08:48,480
Or something...

94
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:54,320
Which is why they offered me the gig,
because I can link with Tommy's avatar.

95
00:08:54,355 --> 00:08:56,800
Which is insanely expensive.

96
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:58,765
Is this right?

97
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,965
I just say whatever
to the video log?

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,460
Yeah, we gotta get the habit
of documenting everything.

99
00:09:03,495 --> 00:09:05,885
What we see, what we feel,
it's all part of the science.

100
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,000
Science is good observation.
- Plus it'll help keep you sane.

101
00:09:09,035 --> 00:09:12,000
for the next 6 years.

102
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:14,200
Whatever.

103
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,600
Here I am.

104
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,080
Doing science.

105
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,965
They're coming out.

106
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,320
<i>Attention, drivers coming out of the lane.</i>

107
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,300
Who's got my god
damn cigarette?

108
00:09:43,335 --> 00:09:46,920
Guys, what's wrong with this picture?

109
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:48,765
Thank you!

110
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,565
Grace Augustine is a legend.

111
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,365
She's the head of the avatar
program, she wrote the book.

112
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,320
I mean literally wrote the
book on Pandoran botany.

113
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:59,080
That's because she likes
plants better than people.

114
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,965
Here she is, Cinderella back from the ball.

115
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,400
Grace I'd like you to meet
Norm Spellman and Jake Sully.

116
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,200
Norm, I hear good things about
you. How's your Na'vi?

117
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:15,600
<i>If I may, Great Mother,
it's a pleasure to meet you.</i>

118
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:19,520
<i>Not bad, a bit rough though.</i>

119
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,480
<i>I've studied for 5 years,
but I still have much to learn.</i>

120
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:28,285
Grace, this is Jake Sully.

121
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,165
I know who you are
and I don't need you.

122
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,805
I need your brother, the PHD

123
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,480
who trained for three
years for this mission...

124
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,685
He's dead.

125
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,080
I know it's a big inconvenience
for everyone.

126
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
How much lab training have you had?

127
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:46,200
I dissected a frog once.

128
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,565
You see?

129
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,400
They're just pissing on us with out even
a courtesy of calling it rain.

130
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,920
I'm going to Selfridge.
- No Grace!

131
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,480
This is such bullshit.

132
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,020
I'm gonna kick his corporate butt.

133
00:10:59,021 --> 00:11:01,520
He has no business sticking
his nose in my department.

134
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,125
Here tomorrow, 08:00.

135
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,320
Try and use big words.

136
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,965
Did you see that?
- Yes sir.

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No you didn't, you were looking at
the monitor. I love this putter Ronnie.

138
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,565
Parker...

139
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,400
I used to think it
was a knowing neglect,

140
00:11:40,401 --> 00:11:43,200
but now I see that you're
intentionally screwing me.

141
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:47,200
Grace, I enjoy our little talks...

142
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,480
I need a researcher,
not some jar-head drop out.

143
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,400
Actually, I thought we
got lucky with him.

144
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:57,965
Lucky?
- Yeah.

145
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,165
How is this in any way lucky?

146
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky
that brother wasn't some oral hygienist.

147
00:12:05,235 --> 00:12:08,880
A marine we could use. I'm assigning him
to your team as security escort.

148
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,965
The last thing I need is another
trigger happy moron out there.

149
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,060
You're supposed to be
winning the hearts and the

150
00:12:15,061 --> 00:12:17,120
minds of the natives, isn't that the
whole point of your little puppet show?

151
00:12:17,155 --> 00:12:20,600
You look like them, you talk like
them and they'll start trusting us.

152
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,765
We build them a school,
we teach them English...

153
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,600
But after how many years relations with
the indigenous are only getting worse.

154
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:29,800
That tends to happen when you
use machine guns on them.

155
00:12:29,835 --> 00:12:32,080
Right, come here.

156
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,965
This is why we're here, Unobtanium.

157
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,080
Because this little gray
rock sells for 20 million a kilo.

158
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,400
That's the only reason.
It's what pays for the whole party.

159
00:12:47,435 --> 00:12:50,677
It's what pays for
your science, comprendo?

160
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:53,885
Those savages are threatening
our whole operation.

161
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,320
We're on the brink of war and you're

162
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:58,720
supposed to be finding
a diplomatic solution.

163
00:12:58,755 --> 00:13:02,480
So use what you've got
and get me some results.

164
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,080
How much link time do you log?

165
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,280
About 520 hours.
- That's good.

166
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,165
You're in there,
you're here.

167
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,800
How much have you logged?
- Zip.

168
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,560
But I red the manual.

169
00:13:27,595 --> 00:13:29,920
Tell me you're joking.

170
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,600
This is cool.

171
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,600
Let's go.

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,600
Don't, I got this.

173
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,700
So you just figured you'd come out here

174
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,400
to the most hostile environment
known to man...

175
00:13:49,435 --> 00:13:53,120
with no training of any kind
and see how it went?

176
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:55,485
What was going through your head?

177
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,000
Maybe I was sick of doctors
telling me what I couldn't do.

178
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:02,200
Biometrics look good.
- Link is ready.

179
00:14:02,235 --> 00:14:04,480
Keep your arms in,
hands in.

180
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
Head down.

181
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Just relax and let your mind go blank.

182
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,080
That shouldn't be hard for you.

183
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,080
Kiss the darkest part of my...
- Initiate link.

184
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:22,000
Run sequence, unit 3.
- Launching.

185
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,000
I have the first congruency.

186
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,480
That's a gorgeous brain.
Nice activity.

187
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,520
Go figure.
- Phase lock 40%.

188
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,120
I'm going in.

189
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,080
Phase lock 99%,
link is stable.

190
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,565
Jake can you hear me?

191
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,520
Fibrial reflexes look good.

192
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,280
Response normal.
How are you feeling Jake?

193
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,680
Hey guys.

194
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,085
Welcome to your
new body Jake. - Good.

195
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,000
We're gonna take this
nice and easy Jake.

196
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,480
No problem.
- I can see you remember that one.

197
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,165
Well, if you want to
sit up, that's fine.

198
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,880
Let's take it nice and slow Jake.
No tranquil attacks, that's good.

199
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,965
Do you feel lightheaded or dizzy?

200
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,880
Wiggling your toes.
- Good Jake.

201
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,080
System motor control is good.

202
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,720
Are you feeling any numbness or pain?

203
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,565
Take it easy, don't get
ahead of yourself.

204
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,080
There are few more sensory and motor
reflex tests we need to run, so tak it easy.

205
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,080
Jake listen to me.

206
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,280
Jake I need you to sit down.
- It's OK, I got this.

207
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,900
Jake you need to sit down.
- Guys get him back on the gurney.

208
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,480
You need to sit down...

209
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,480
Sedate him!

210
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,680
1000 mg, fast!

211
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,080
Jake, you're not used to your
avatar body, this is dangerous.

212
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,280
This is great.
- Come on, they're gonna put you out.

213
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
Sit down!

214
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,400
Come on, you ain't got no skills.

215
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,400
I don't even have to
play defense. - Hey guys.

216
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,800
It's OK, I'll get him.
- Jake you have to come inside.

217
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Sorry.

218
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,400
You're not supposed to be running!

219
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,000
Sorry.
- Watch it.

220
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,160
Marine!

221
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:55,520
Damn...

222
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,565
Grace?

223
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Who did you expect numb nuts?

224
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,165
Think fast!

225
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,080
Motor control is looking good.

226
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,860
Everybody quiet down.

227
00:18:17,895 --> 00:18:20,165
Lights out.

228
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,320
C'mon Louise, chop chop.

229
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,600
Don't play with that,
you'll go blind.

230
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,400
That's kinda freaky.
- C'mon.

231
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,200
Lights out, see you at dinner kitties.

232
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,400
Welcome back.

233
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,320
You all right?
- I'm OK.

234
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,680
I'm Trudy, I fly all the scientzoids.

235
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,320
And this here is my baby.

236
00:19:20,355 --> 00:19:22,480
Hold on a second.

237
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,885
Wainfleet get it done.

238
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,600
We bounce at 09:00.
- I'm on it captain.

239
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,680
is still loose.
- You guys are packing some heavy gear.

240
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,880
Watch it!

241
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,520
That's cos we're not the only
ones flying around out there.

242
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,285
Or the biggest.

243
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,400
But I need you on a door gun.
I'm a man short.

244
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,600
Thought you'd never ask.

245
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,120
There's your man.
See you on the flight lane.

246
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,765
You wanted to see me colonel?

247
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,880
This low gravity
will make you soft.

248
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,200
You get soft...

249
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,480
Pandora will shit you out
dead with zero warning.

250
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,660
I pulled your record corporal.

251
00:20:19,695 --> 00:20:22,800
Venezuela, that was some mean bush.

252
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,680
Nothing like this here though.

253
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,565
You got some heart kid,
showing up in this neighborhood.

254
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,320
Figured it's just another hell hole.
- I was the first recon myself.

255
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:40,400
Few years ahead of you,
well maybe more than a few.

256
00:20:40,435 --> 00:20:43,600
Three tours in Nigeria,
not a scratch.

257
00:20:43,635 --> 00:20:45,680
I come out here...

258
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,520
Day one, think I felt
like a shaved tale.

259
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,080
They could fix me up,
if I rotated back.

260
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,680
Make me pretty again.

261
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,680
But you know what,
I kinda like it.

262
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,680
It reminds me every day
what's waiting out there.

263
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,880
Avatar program is a bad joke.

264
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,660
Bunch a limp dick
science majors.

265
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:15,007
However, it does present
an opportunity

266
00:21:15,042 --> 00:21:19,320
most timely and unique, clear!

267
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,565
A recon giri in an avatar body.

268
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,165
That's a potent mix,
gives me the goosebumps.

269
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,600
Such a marine could provide the
intel I need, right on the ground.

270
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,285
Right in the hostile's camp.

271
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,600
Look Sully, I want you to learn
about this savages on the inside,

272
00:21:45,635 --> 00:21:47,565
I want you to gain their trust.

273
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,080
I need to know how o force their cooperation
or hammer them hard if they won't.

274
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,800
Am I still with Augustine?
- On paper.

275
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:58,320
You walk like on of her science pukes,

276
00:21:58,355 --> 00:22:00,480
you quak like one...

277
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,040
But you report to me.

278
00:22:04,075 --> 00:22:06,880
Can you do that for me son?

279
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,680
Hell yeah sir.

280
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,480
Well all right then.

281
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,485
Son, I take care of my own.

282
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
You get me what I need,
I'll see to it you get

283
00:22:28,001 --> 00:22:30,480
your legs back when you rotate home.

284
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,600
Your real legs.

285
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,680
That sounds real good sir.

286
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Link's ready.

287
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,280
Just keep your mouth shut
and let Norm do the talking.

288
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
All right, I'm going in.

289
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,880
Shut it down, we're gonna stay a while.

290
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,200
Norm, your pack.

291
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,680
Stay with the ship.

292
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,600
One idiot with a gun is enough.

293
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,600
You the man doc.

294
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,480
Prolemurs, they're not aggressive.

295
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,600
Relax marine, you're making me nervous.

296
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:24,320
How will they know we're here?
- I'm sure they're watching us right now.

297
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,080
Keep moving Norm.
- Keep up guys.

298
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,080
And here I go.
- Scanning.

299
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,520
It's that fast?

300
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,685
Amazing isn't it?

301
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,440
That is signal transduction

302
00:25:47,475 --> 00:25:50,200
from this root to the root
of the tree next to it.

303
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,280
We should take a sample.

304
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,480
It's probably electrical,
based on the speed of the reaction.

305
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
Norm, you've contaminated
the sample with your saliva.

306
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:06,480
Don't shot, you'll piss him off.

307
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,965
It's already pissed off.

308
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,400
Jake, that armor is
too thick, trust me.

309
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,400
It's a territorial threat display,
do not run or he'll charge.

310
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,520
So what do I do?
Dance with it?

311
00:27:27,555 --> 00:27:31,400
Just, hold your ground.

312
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,460
C'mon, what you got?!

313
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:51,120
Who's bad?
That's right.

314
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,120
That's what I'm talking about bitch.

315
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,485
That's right, get your
punk ass back to mommy.

316
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,680
You got nothing, keep running.
Why don't you bring back some friends.

317
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,520
What about this one?
Run, don't run, what?!

318
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Run, definitely run!

319
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,520
We're gonna have to call it guys,
we're not allowed to run night ops, orders.

320
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,080
Sorry doc, he's just gonna
have to hang on till morning.

321
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,120
He won't make it till morning.

322
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,280
I don't have all god damn night.

323
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,120
Come on!

324
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,000
Wait, don't!

325
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Great.

326
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,720
I know you probably
don't understand this.

327
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,400
But...

328
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,280
Thank you.

329
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,280
Thank you.

330
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,280
That was pretty impressive.

331
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,120
I would have been screwed
if you hadn't come along.

332
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,200
Wait a second,
where are you going?

333
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,300
Wait up.

334
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:19,165
Slow down.

335
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,480
I just wanted to say thanks
for killing those things...

336
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,280
Don't thank.

337
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,480
You don't thank for this.

338
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,420
This is sad.

339
00:37:33,455 --> 00:37:36,027
Very sad, only.

340
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:38,600
OK, I'm sorry.

341
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,000
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

342
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,285
All this is your fault,
they did not need to die.

343
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,480
My fault? They attacked me,
how am I the bad guy?

344
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,400
Your fault!
- Easy.

345
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,800
You're like a baby, making noise,
don't know what to do.

346
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,280
If you love your
little forest friends...

347
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,120
Why not let them just kill my ass?

348
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,565
What's the thinking?

349
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,880
Why save you?
- Why save me?

350
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,520
You have a strong heart.

351
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,120
No fear.

352
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,480
But stupid, ignorant like a child.

353
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,880
Well if I'm like a child...

354
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,365
Maybe you should teach me.

355
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,520
Sky people can not learn, you do not see.
- Teach me how to see.

356
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:54,480
No one can teach you to see.

357
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,480
Come on, can't we talk?

358
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:01,020
Where did you learn to speak english?

359
00:39:01,055 --> 00:39:03,520
Dr. Augustine's school?

360
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,480
You're like a baby.

361
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,080
I need your help.

362
00:39:18,115 --> 00:39:20,880
You should not be here.

363
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:24,480
OK, take me with you.
- No, go back.

364
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,120
No.

365
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,880
Go back.

366
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,600
What are they?

367
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,120
Seeds of the sacred tree.

368
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:28,720
Very pure spirits.

369
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,400
What was that all about?

370
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Come.

371
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,280
Where are we going?

372
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,320
Come.

373
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,480
What's your name?

374
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:54,000
<i>Everyone back off!</i>

375
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,400
<i>Tsu'tey, what are you doing?</i>

376
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,520
<i>This demon should not be here.</i>

377
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,565
<i>I saw a sign.</i>

378
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,800
<i>We must take him to Tsahik.</i>

379
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,000
<i>Bring him.</i>

380
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
What's going on?

381
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,800
What's happening?

382
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
<i>Father...</i>

383
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,400
<i>I hear you.</i>

384
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,400
<i>This creature, why did you bring it here?</i>

385
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,485
<i>I wanted to kill him,
but I saw a sign from Eywa.</i>

386
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,520
<i>I said that no night
walker may come here.</i>

387
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:13,485
What's he saying?

388
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,400
<i>My nose twists from its stench.</i>

389
00:44:16,435 --> 00:44:17,365
What's he saying?

390
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,480
My father is deciding
whether to kill you.

391
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,165
Your father?

392
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,600
It's nice to meet you sir.

393
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:30,000
<i>Everyone stop!</i>

394
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,380
<i>I'm amazed at this alien.</i>

395
00:44:35,415 --> 00:44:38,207
That is mother, she is Tsahik,

396
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,000
the one who interprets the will of Eywa.

397
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,080
Who's Eywa?

398
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,880
What are you called?

399
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:54,080
Jake Sully.

400
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,440
Why did you come to us?

401
00:45:05,475 --> 00:45:07,565
I came to learn.

402
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,200
We have tried to teach
other sky people.

403
00:45:11,235 --> 00:45:14,800
It is hard to fill a cup
which is already full.

404
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,965
My cup is empty,
trust me.

405
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:22,000
Ask dr. Augustine,
I'm no scientist.

406
00:45:22,035 --> 00:45:24,200
What are you.

407
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,000
I was a marine.

408
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,765
A warrior, of the jarhead clan.

409
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,920
<i>Him a warrior?
I could easily kill him.</i>

410
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,360
<i>This is the first warrior
we encountered</i>

411
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:43,365
<i>among the sleepers.</i>

412
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,000
<i>We must learn more about him.</i>

413
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,765
<i>Daughter...</i>

414
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,760
<i>You will teach him our ways,</i>

415
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:58,837
<i>to talk and act as we do.</i>

416
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:02,880
<i>Why me?
It's not fair.</i>

417
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,880
It is decided.

418
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,200
My daughter will teach you our ways,

419
00:46:07,235 --> 00:46:11,485
learn well Jake Sully.

420
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:16,720
And we will see if your
insanity can be cured.

421
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,080
Good evening.

422
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,720
Please don't get up.

423
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:48,000
Sorry.

424
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,480
Hey, how you doing?

425
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,800
Jake.
- He's coming out.

426
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,200
Come on back kid.
That's it.

427
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,800
There you go.

428
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:55,680
You were talking like a tick.

429
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:01,400
Is the avatar safe?
- Yeah doc.

430
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:05,600
You are not gonna
believe where I am.

431
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:09,660
The last thing we see
is this marine's ass

432
00:48:09,695 --> 00:48:13,120
disappearing in the bush with this
angry Thanator coming after him.

433
00:48:13,155 --> 00:48:15,600
It's not something you could teach.

434
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:20,800
For reasons I cannot fathom
the Omaticaya have chosen you.

435
00:48:20,835 --> 00:48:23,000
God help us all.

436
00:48:23,035 --> 00:48:25,520
Jarhead clan?

437
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,165
And it worked?

438
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,480
I'm practically family.

439
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,965
They're gonna study me,
I have to learn to be one of them.

440
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,200
That's called taking initiative son,
Wish I had ten more like you,

441
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:41,520
Sully, just find out what
the blue monkeys want.

442
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,000
We tried to give them
medicine, education...

443
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,800
Roads, but no, they like mud.

444
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,000
And that wouldn't bother
me, it's just that they're...

445
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:58,400
Can somebody just...
Sector 12.

446
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:04,320
Stop.

447
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,680
Their damn village
happens to be resting on

448
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,200
the richest Unobtanium deposit
within 200 clicks in any direction.

449
00:49:14,235 --> 00:49:17,000
I mean, look at all that chatter.

450
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:23,280
Who gets them to move?
- Guess.

451
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,880
What if they won't go?

452
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:29,280
I'm betting that they will.

453
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,200
Killing the indigenous looks bad.

454
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,000
But there's one thing that shareholders
hate more than bad press.

455
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:42,480
And that's a bad corely statement.
I didn't make up the rules.

456
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,080
So just find me a carrot
that will get them to move.

457
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,885
Otherwise it's going to
have to be his stick.

458
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,520
You got three months,
that's when the dozers get there.

459
00:49:53,555 --> 00:49:56,200
We're wasting time.

460
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,000
I like this guy.

461
00:49:59,035 --> 00:50:01,200
OK, let's run through them again.

462
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,400
Moat, dragon lady.

463
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:07,485
Eytuken.
- Eytukan

464
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,480
He's the clan leader,
she's their spiritual leader.

465
00:50:10,520 --> 00:50:13,000
Like a shaman.
- Got it.

466
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,085
Tsutey.
- Tsu'tey

467
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:20,000
He'll be the next clan leader.

468
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,280
Neytiri.
- She'll be the next Tsahik.

469
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,600
They become a mated pair.

470
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,000
So who's this Eywa?
- Who's Eywa?!

471
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,300
Only their deity, their goddess
made up of all living things.

472
00:50:33,335 --> 00:50:36,827
Everything they know. You'd know this if
you had any training whatsoever.

473
00:50:36,862 --> 00:50:40,320
Who's got a date with
the chief's daughter?

474
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,200
Let's go, village life starts early.

475
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,920
Don't do anything unusually stupid.

476
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,600
Easy boy.

477
00:51:08,635 --> 00:51:11,000
It's a female.

478
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,120
Easy girl

479
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,080
That is Sa'helu, the bond.

480
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,080
Feel her.

481
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,400
Feel her heart beat.

482
00:51:57,435 --> 00:52:00,320
Her breath.

483
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:04,200
Feel her strong legs.

484
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,080
You may tell her what to do, inside.

485
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,600
For now, say her to go.

486
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,480
Forward.

487
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,660
You should go away.

488
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:39,947
You'd miss me.

489
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:42,200
I knew you could speak english.

490
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:49,520
<i>This alien doesn't learn.
Even the stone understands better.</i>

491
00:52:49,555 --> 00:52:52,080
<i>Just look at him.</i>

492
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,965
Again.

493
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,900
If you want to hit this thing,
it's going to be complicated.

494
00:53:04,935 --> 00:53:08,107
Your scan doesn't show
the internal structure.

495
00:53:08,142 --> 00:53:11,280
There's an outer row of columns,
real heavy duty.

496
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:14,000
There's a secondary ring here,
and an inner ring.

497
00:53:14,035 --> 00:53:17,200
There's a core structure like a spiral.

498
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,965
That's how they move up and down.

499
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,800
We're gonna need accurate
scans of every column.

500
00:53:21,835 --> 00:53:23,485
Roger that.

501
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,165
What else can you tell us
about the structure?

502
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:29,520
I'm guessing this secondary ring,
that's also load bearing.

503
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,680
Where are we going?

504
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,165
Gettin out of Dodge.

505
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:42,365
I'm not about to let Selfridge and
Quaritch micromanage this thing.

506
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,800
There's a mobile link up as site 26, we can
work at it, way up in the mountains.

507
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,840
The Hallelujah mountains?

508
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:53,200
That's right.
- Are you serious?

509
00:53:53,235 --> 00:53:55,520
Yeah.

510
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:02,480
The legendary floating mountains
of Pandora, heard of them?

511
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,965
We're getting close.

512
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,400
Yeah, look at my instruments.

513
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,080
We're in the flux vortex.

514
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,280
VFR from here on.
- What's VFR?

515
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,600
Means you got to see
where you're going.

516
00:54:30,635 --> 00:54:33,200
You can't see anything.
- Egzactly.

517
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:35,680
Ain't that a bitch.

518
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,480
Oh my God...

519
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,800
You should see your faces.

520
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,520
Thank you for flying Air Pandora.

521
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
Welcome to the camp.

522
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,800
This is my bunk.
- This stuff is nasty.

523
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,280
Norm, go under.

524
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,520
<i>Grace didn't miss a thing.</i>

525
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,085
<i>She knew i was
talking to the colonel.</i>

526
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,720
<i>But I had what she needed,
a way back in with the clan.</i>

527
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:21,000
<i>So she's playing nice.</i>

528
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,365
Jake, left.

529
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,720
You'll be in the link at the end.

530
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,280
Unit 1, Bueler.

531
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,920
She's the least glitchy.

532
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,885
Holy shit.

533
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,600
Do not look in her eye.

534
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,280
Ikran is not horse.

535
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,320
When Sa'helu is made...

536
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,280
Ikran will fly well.

537
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,800
Only one hunter
in the whole life.

538
00:57:57,400 --> 00:58:00,080
To become Aron'yu, hunter...

539
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:04,600
You must choose your own
Ikran and he must choose you.

540
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,000
When?
- When you are ready.

541
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:02,960
This is video log 12.

542
00:59:02,995 --> 00:59:05,485
Time is 21:32.

543
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,680
Do I have to do this now?
I really need to get some rack.

544
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:13,280
No, now, when it's fresh.

545
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:17,680
Location, shack.

546
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,800
Days are starting to pull
everything together.

547
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,965
<i>The language is a pain, but...</i>

548
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,120
<i>I figure it's like field stripping a
weapon, repetition, repetition...</i>

549
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,480
Don't worry, stronger.

550
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,080
<i>Neytiri calls me Scoun.</i>

551
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,000
<i>It means moron.</i>

552
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,600
<i>Norm's attitude is
improved lately.</i>

553
00:59:51,635 --> 00:59:54,000
But it's not just I'm
seeing you in frot of me

554
00:59:54,035 --> 00:59:55,680
I see into you...

555
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:58,720
<i>It's good he's back on board,
but he thinks I'm a Scoun too.</i>

556
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,280
You've got to run, OK?

557
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,165
Let's go.

558
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,085
<i>I feel I'm getting tougher.</i>

559
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:09,965
<i>I can run farther every day.</i>

560
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,280
<i>I have to trust my body
to know what to do.</i>

561
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
Check it out.

562
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,680
Crap.

563
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,565
<i>Every day it's reading the trail,</i>

564
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:33,680
<i>track's of the wild home,
tiniest scents and sounds.</i>

565
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,480
<i>She's always going on
about the flow of energy</i>

566
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:44,880
<i>the spirits of animals.</i>

567
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,800
<i>I really hope this tree hugging
crap isn't on the final.</i>

568
01:00:47,835 --> 01:00:51,400
This isn't just about eye-hand
coordination out there you know.

569
01:00:51,435 --> 01:00:53,965
You need to listen to what she says.

570
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,000
Try to see the forest
through her eyes.

571
01:00:57,035 --> 01:01:00,000
Excuse me, this is my video log here.

572
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,800
<i>With Neytiri it's
learn fast or die.</i>

573
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:21,920
You got to be kidding me.

574
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:54,400
<i>I talked Moat into letting Grace
into the village. - You are all so grown.</i>

575
01:01:54,435 --> 01:01:58,720
<i>First time since her school was
closed down. - You are all so nice.</i>

576
01:01:58,755 --> 01:02:01,800
No you don't, come back here.

577
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:06,000
Bon apetit.

578
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:34,880
Come on.

579
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,700
<i>I'm trying to understand
this deep connection</i>

580
01:03:01,701 --> 01:03:04,200
<i>the people have to the forest.</i>

581
01:03:04,235 --> 01:03:07,965
<i>She talks about a network of energy.</i>

582
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,680
<i>That flows through all living things.</i>

583
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:15,860
<i>She says, all energy is only borrowed.</i>

584
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:20,000
<i>And one day you
have to give it back.</i>

585
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,200
<i>I hear you brother.</i>

586
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,680
<i>And thank you.</i>

587
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,320
<i>Your spirit will go to Eywa.</i>

588
01:03:53,355 --> 01:03:56,317
<i>And your body will remain</i>

589
01:03:56,352 --> 01:03:59,280
<i>to become a part of the People.</i>

590
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,320
A clean kill.

591
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:08,720
You are ready.

592
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
Learning to ride an Ikran,
we call them Banshees,

593
01:04:37,035 --> 01:04:40,000
is the test every young
hunter has to pass.

594
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:45,920
But to do that, you got to go
where the banshees are.

595
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:21,120
Now what?

596
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,600
Jake Sully will go first.

597
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,880
Now you choose your Ikran.

598
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,485
This you must feel inside.

599
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,400
If he also chooses you
move quick like i showed.

600
01:07:32,435 --> 01:07:34,800
You will have one chance Jake.

601
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,600
How will I know if he chooses me?

602
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:40,200
He will try to kill you.

603
01:07:40,235 --> 01:07:43,120
Outstanding.

604
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,720
Let's dance.

605
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,080
<i>The fool wants to die.</i>

606
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,280
<i>Don't be affraid warrior.</i>

607
01:09:18,281 --> 01:09:20,581
Make the bond!

608
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,120
Jake!

609
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:45,100
Sa'Helu Jake!

610
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:48,600
Sa'Helu!

611
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,400
Stop!

612
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:12,280
That's right, you're mine.

613
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:29,520
First flight seals the bond,
you can not wait.

614
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:33,120
Think fly.
- Fly?

615
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:43,520
God damn...

616
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,280
Shit!

617
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:01,520
Shut up and fly straight!

618
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,485
That's it.

619
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:13,720
Bank left.

620
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,800
Level up!
That's it.

621
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,800
Baby I got this!

622
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,720
Shit!

623
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:29,000
<i>I may not be much of a horse guy,
but I was born to do this.</i>

624
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,365
I came like this,
this you,

625
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:37,920
I turn, I feel the wind,
I turn very strong.

626
01:12:37,955 --> 01:12:40,000
I see, I bank so hard.

627
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,720
The Tree of Souls.

628
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,280
It's their most sacred place.

629
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,800
See the flux vortex and
these false color images?

630
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,485
That's what messes up my instruments.

631
01:13:55,520 --> 01:14:01,000
There is something really interesting
going on in there biologicaly.

632
01:14:01,035 --> 01:14:03,765
I would die to get samples.

633
01:14:03,800 --> 01:14:06,600
Outsiders are strictly forbidden.

634
01:14:06,635 --> 01:14:09,520
You lucky swine.

635
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,400
<i>I was a stone cold
aerial hunter.</i>

636
01:14:18,435 --> 01:14:20,480
<i>Death from above.</i>

637
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,480
<i>Only problem is,
you're not the only one.</i>

638
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,720
Dive!

639
01:15:00,720 --> 01:15:02,720
Follow me!

640
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:52,160
Guys call it a Great Leonopteryx.

641
01:15:52,195 --> 01:15:55,720
It is Toruk, last shadow.

642
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:00,720
Right, it's the last one
you ever see.

643
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:08,480
My grandfather's grandfather
was Toruk Makto.

644
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:11,400
Rider of last shadow.

645
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:14,400
He rode this?

646
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:17,085
Toruk chose him.

647
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:21,200
It has only happen five times since
the time from the first songs.

648
01:16:21,235 --> 01:16:23,685
That's a long time.
- Yes.

649
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,280
Toruk Makto was mighty.

650
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:31,200
He brought the clans together
in a time of Great Sorrow.

651
01:16:31,235 --> 01:16:35,120
All Na'vi people know the story.

652
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,965
<i>Everything is backwards now.</i>

653
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:46,880
<i>Like out there is the true world,
and in here is the dream.</i>

654
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:11,600
I can't believe it's only
been three months.

655
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,280
I don't even remember my whole life.

656
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,800
I don't even know who I am any more.

657
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:43,280
Haven't got lost in
the woods, have you?

658
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,800
Your last report was more
than two weeks ago.

659
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:54,800
I started to doubt your resolve.

660
01:17:56,720 --> 01:18:00,200
Way I see it, it's time to terminate
the mission. - I can do this.

661
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,765
You already have.

662
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:05,920
You've given me good usable intel.

663
01:18:05,955 --> 01:18:08,765
This Tree of Souls place...

664
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:12,200
I got them by the balls with that
when this turns into a shit fight

665
01:18:12,235 --> 01:18:14,565
which it will.

666
01:18:14,600 --> 01:18:17,920
Now is time to come in.

667
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:22,880
By the way, you're gonna
get your legs back.

668
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,800
I got you corporative approval.

669
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:29,520
It's a done deal,
gonna have you on a shuttle tonight.

670
01:18:29,555 --> 01:18:32,600
I'm a man of my word.

671
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,800
I got to finish this.

672
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,800
It's one more thing.

673
01:18:40,835 --> 01:18:42,720
Ceremony...

674
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,000
It's the final stage of becoming a man.

675
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,880
If I do it, I'm one of them.

676
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:54,280
They'll trust me.

677
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,720
And I can negotiate the
terms of their relocation.

678
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,720
Than you better get
it done corporal.

679
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,920
<i>Na'vi say, every person is born twice.</i>

680
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,280
<i>The second time is
when you earn</i>

681
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:46,600
<i>your place among
the people, forever.</i>

682
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:55,280
<i>You are now a son
of the Omaticaya.</i>

683
01:19:56,400 --> 01:20:00,880
<i>You are part of the People.</i>

684
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,080
Come.

685
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,200
This is a place for
prayers to be heard.

686
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:13,000
And sometimes answered.

687
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,800
We call this tree...

688
01:21:22,835 --> 01:21:26,000
The Tree of Voices.

689
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:30,400
The voices of ancestors.

690
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:46,400
I can hear them

691
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:54,000
They live Jake.

692
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:57,000
Within Eywa.

693
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,480
You are Omaticaya now.

694
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,280
You may make your bow
from the wood of Hometree.

695
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,800
And you may choose a woman.

696
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:18,280
We have many fine women.

697
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:21,600
Nenat is the best singer.

698
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,480
I don't want Nenat.

699
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,600
Paral is good hunter.

700
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,000
She is a good hunter.

701
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:40,280
I've already chosen.

702
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,400
But this woman must also choose me.

703
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:52,400
She already has.

704
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,960
I'm with you now Jake.

705
01:23:24,995 --> 01:23:28,400
We are mated for life.

706
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,000
<i>What the hell are you doing Jake?</i>

707
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,600
Don't forget the phase
integration, middle button.

708
01:24:09,635 --> 01:24:11,720
You got to eat something.

709
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:21,965
Jake!

710
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:25,000
Wake up please!

711
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,720
Don't make me force feed a cripple.

712
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,880
There, I'm done, let's go.

713
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:01,280
And when was the last
time you took a shower?

714
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,800
I don't need a shower.
- Jesus marine.

715
01:25:07,720 --> 01:25:09,600
Jake!

716
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,800
Wake up!

717
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,200
Stop!

718
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:37,000
Hey boss...

719
01:25:40,880 --> 01:25:43,520
What? - I got a native
doing a funky chicken here.

720
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,965
He's blocking my blade.

721
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:48,480
Keep going, he'll move.

722
01:25:48,520 --> 01:25:51,400
These people have to
learn that we don't stop.

723
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:01,600
You see, he moved.

724
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,000
I'm blind!

725
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,720
Jake!
- Neytiri!

726
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,520
Come on!

727
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,200
Freeze it, right there!

728
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,480
Scale up, enhance.

729
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:10,000
Son of a bitch.

730
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:12,800
Unbelievable.

731
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:15,920
Get me a pilot.
- Yes sir.

732
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,200
<i>Tsu'Tey, will lead our warriors!</i>

733
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:33,000
<i>Please stop!</i>

734
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,200
<i>You will only make it worse!</i>

735
01:27:36,235 --> 01:27:38,480
You do not speak here!

736
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:41,800
<i>We will strike them in the heart!</i>

737
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:52,000
Don't do this!

738
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,600
You!
- Listen, brother...

739
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:04,480
You mated with the human!
- Shit...

740
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:07,520
Is this true?

741
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,965
We are mated before Eywa, it is done.

742
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:16,685
Brother please, do not
attack the sky people.

743
01:28:16,720 --> 01:28:21,000
Many Omatacaya will die if you do.
- You are not my brother!

744
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:26,880
And I am not your enemy!

745
01:28:26,920 --> 01:28:30,320
The enemy is out there!
And they are wery powerful!

746
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:39,400
I can talk to them!
- No more talk!

747
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,000
I am Omaticaya,
I am one of you.

748
01:28:51,035 --> 01:28:54,320
And I have the right to speak.

749
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,480
<i>I have something to say...</i>

750
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:05,120
<i>To all of you.</i>

751
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:10,800
Words I have, stones my heart.

752
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:15,885
Sir I'm sorry.

753
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:18,600
You can't interrupt
the link in progress.

754
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,680
It's very dangerous!

755
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,000
Wait!
- Stay down sir!

756
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:36,480
I was sent here...

757
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,685
<i>You see?!</i>

758
01:29:40,720 --> 01:29:43,400
<i>This is a demon of false flesh!</i>

759
01:30:03,120 --> 01:30:06,720
Are you out of your god damn mind?!
- You crossed the line.

760
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:12,720
Wheel this meat out of here.

761
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,600
Jake! What the hell
is going on here?

762
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:22,000
You let me down son.

763
01:30:23,200 --> 01:30:25,200
So what, you...

764
01:30:26,080 --> 01:30:28,640
You found yourself some local tail

765
01:30:28,641 --> 01:30:31,200
and you completely forget
what team you're playing for?

766
01:30:31,235 --> 01:30:33,920
Parker, there is time to
salvage this situation...

767
01:30:33,955 --> 01:30:36,480
Shut your pie hole!

768
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:38,965
Or what, ranger Rick?

769
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,660
You gonna shoot me?
- I could do that.

770
01:30:41,695 --> 01:30:44,087
You need to muzzle your dog.

771
01:30:44,122 --> 01:30:46,480
Can we take this down a
couple of notches please?

772
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:49,000
You say you want to keep
your people alive?

773
01:30:49,035 --> 01:30:51,085
Start by listening to her.

774
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:54,600
Those trees were sacred to
Omaticaya in a way you can't imagine.

775
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:57,885
You throw a stick in the air...

776
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:01,560
it's gonna land on some
sacred fern.

777
01:31:01,595 --> 01:31:05,165
I'm not talking about
some kind of pagan voodoo

778
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:07,360
I'm talking about something real,

779
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:09,520
something measurable in
a biology of the forest.

780
01:31:09,555 --> 01:31:11,885
Which is what exactly?

781
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:15,365
What we think we know,
is that there's some kind of

782
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:18,880
electro chemical communication
between the roots of the trees.

783
01:31:18,920 --> 01:31:21,085
Like synapses between neurons.

784
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:25,920
And each tree has 10 to the fourth
connections to the trees around it.

785
01:31:25,955 --> 01:31:29,200
And there are 10 to the
tvelfth trees on Pandora.

786
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:32,000
Which is a lot, I'm guessing.

787
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,520
It's more connections
than in the human brain.

788
01:31:35,800 --> 01:31:38,480
Get it?
It's a network.

789
01:31:38,520 --> 01:31:41,800
It's a global network, and
the Na'vi can access it.

790
01:31:41,835 --> 01:31:43,965
They can upload and download data.

791
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:48,480
Memories, at sites like the
one you just destroyed.

792
01:31:50,720 --> 01:31:55,000
What the hell have you people
been smoking out there?

793
01:31:55,680 --> 01:31:59,000
They're just god damn trees.

794
01:31:59,680 --> 01:32:03,000
You need to wake up Parker.
- No, you need to wake up.

795
01:32:03,035 --> 01:32:06,320
The wealth of this world isn't in
the ground, it's all around us.

796
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:10,480
The Na'vi know that, and
they're fighting to defend it

797
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:15,260
If you want to share this world with them,
you need to understand them.

798
01:32:15,295 --> 01:32:20,000
I'd say we understand them just
fine, thanks to Jake here.

799
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,485
Doc, come take a look.

800
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:26,320
<i>They're not gonna
give up their home.</i>

801
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,200
<i>They're not gonna make a deal.</i>

802
01:32:30,720 --> 01:32:33,200
<i>For light beer?</i>

803
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,680
<i>And blue jeans?</i>

804
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,520
<i>There's nothing that
we have that they want.</i>

805
01:32:43,120 --> 01:32:46,600
<i>Everything they sent me out
here to do is a waste of time.</i>

806
01:32:51,120 --> 01:32:54,000
<i>They're never gonna
leave Hometree.</i>

807
01:32:57,280 --> 01:33:02,200
Since a deal can't be made I guess
things get real simple, Jake.

808
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,365
Thanks.

809
01:33:04,400 --> 01:33:08,720
I'm getting all emotional,
might just give you big wet kiss.

810
01:33:08,755 --> 01:33:12,080
I'll do with minimal
casualties to indigenous.

811
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:15,680
I'll drive them out with gas first.

812
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,000
It'll be humane.

813
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,400
More or less.

814
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,520
Alright, let's pull the trigger.

815
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,880
This is how it's done.

816
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,565
When people are sitting on shit you want,
you make them your enemy.

817
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:43,920
you make them your enemy,
then you justify taking it.

818
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:46,800
Quatrich has just rolled in the gunships.

819
01:33:46,835 --> 01:33:49,680
He's gonna hit Hometree.
- My God.

820
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,720
Dr. Augustine, you cannot be up here!

821
01:33:58,755 --> 01:33:59,685
Back off!

822
01:33:59,720 --> 01:34:02,165
Parker, wait, stop,

823
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,565
These are people
you're about to...

824
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:08,320
They're fly bitten savages
that live in a tree.

825
01:34:08,355 --> 01:34:09,965
Look around.

826
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:12,200
I don't know about you
but I see a lot of trees.

827
01:34:12,235 --> 01:34:14,080
They can move.

828
01:34:14,120 --> 01:34:16,320
Can you guys just please...
- There are families in there.

829
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:19,560
Children, babies...
Are you gonna kill children?

830
01:34:19,595 --> 01:34:22,320
You don't want that kind
of blood on your hands, believe me.

831
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,480
Let me try to talk them out.

832
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:28,880
They trust me.

833
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:33,400
Calibrate path,
we're going in.

834
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,965
Listen to me,
you've got one hour.

835
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,400
Unless you want your girlfriend in
there when the axe comes down

836
01:34:47,435 --> 01:34:51,200
you get them to evacuate.
One hour.

837
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:58,765
<i>Father!
Mother!</i>

838
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:02,200
<i>Eytukan, I have something to say.</i>

839
01:35:02,235 --> 01:35:04,165
<i>Listen to him.</i>

840
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:06,965
<i>Speak, Jake Sully.</i>

841
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:10,480
<i>A great evil is upon us.</i>

842
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,600
<i>Sky people are coming this way...</i>

843
01:35:12,635 --> 01:35:15,600
<i>To destroy our home.</i>

844
01:35:15,635 --> 01:35:17,965
<i>Destroy!</i>

845
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:20,000
Tell them they're gonna
be here soon.

846
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:24,320
You have to leave,
or you're gonna die.

847
01:35:24,355 --> 01:35:27,280
Are you certain of this?

848
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,480
They sent me here...

849
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,765
to learn your ways.

850
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:39,120
So one day I could bring this message,
and that you would believe it.

851
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:42,965
What are you saying Jake?

852
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:45,680
You knew this would happen?

853
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,365
Yes.

854
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:52,320
At first, it was just my orders.

855
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:55,520
And then, everything changed.

856
01:35:55,555 --> 01:35:57,965
I fell in love.

857
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,760
I fell in love with the forest.

858
01:36:00,795 --> 01:36:03,520
With the Omaticaya people.

859
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,320
With you.

860
01:36:08,880 --> 01:36:12,000
I trusted you.
- Trust me now, please.

861
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:21,460
You will never be
one of the people!

862
01:36:21,495 --> 01:36:23,920
He tried to stop them!

863
01:36:30,200 --> 01:36:32,320
<i>Tie them up.</i>

864
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,285
<i>Come here.</i>

865
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:37,680
You have to go,
they are coming!

866
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,320
Run to the forest!
- They're coming!

867
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:19,805
They want to destroy this place.

868
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:21,920
Neytiri, you must go now.

869
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,000
Get to the forest!
Run!

870
01:37:29,920 --> 01:37:31,565
Run!

871
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,880
<i>Don't be affraid!</i>

872
01:37:53,520 --> 01:37:55,885
Damn it, run!

873
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,200
<i>Take the Ikran's
and attack them from the sky.</i>

874
01:38:03,280 --> 01:38:06,080
That's one big damn tree.

875
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,965
Well, well.

876
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:18,080
I'd say diplomacy has failed.

877
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,485
Alright people, let's get this done.

878
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,080
I want every gas round you
got right in the front door.

879
01:38:24,120 --> 01:38:26,720
Roger, CS-40's going hot.

880
01:38:26,755 --> 01:38:28,800
Fire.
- Firing.

881
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:41,520
Bingo, good shooting ace.

882
01:38:49,120 --> 01:38:51,120
Sir, they've opened fire.

883
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,280
You got to be kidding me.

884
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:09,565
These dumb bastards
ain't getting the message.

885
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:12,600
Let's turn up the heat,
switch incindirareis.

886
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,080
Fire.

887
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:35,680
<i>Take everyone to the forest!</i>

888
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,720
And that's how you
scatter the roaches.

889
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:46,000
Neytiri...

890
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,720
We gotta move, he's gonna
blow the columns!

891
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,480
Moat, no!

892
01:40:18,520 --> 01:40:21,000
If you are one of us...

893
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:23,680
Help us.

894
01:40:30,720 --> 01:40:32,880
All callsigns switch missiles.

895
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,680
<i>Give me a chease at the
base of the west columns.</i>

896
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,000
This way!

897
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:47,200
Yeah baby, get some!

898
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,600
Bring it down.

899
01:40:57,680 --> 01:40:59,680
Come on Grace, move!

900
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:03,920
Get down!

901
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:17,485
Screw this.

902
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:19,165
What the hell are you doing?

903
01:41:19,200 --> 01:41:22,600
I didn't sign up for this shit!

904
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,400
Go!

905
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:02,080
Good work people.

906
01:44:02,120 --> 01:44:04,200
First round's on me tonight.

907
01:44:04,235 --> 01:44:06,000
Let's boogie.

908
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,000
<i>Father...</i>

909
01:44:37,680 --> 01:44:40,165
<i>Daughter...</i>

910
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:43,400
<i>Take my bow.</i>

911
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:51,920
<i>Protect the people.</i>

912
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:02,480
Neytiri!

913
01:45:11,800 --> 01:45:14,540
I'm sorry.

914
01:45:14,575 --> 01:45:17,280
Get away!

915
01:45:18,320 --> 01:45:20,720
Get away from here!

916
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,720
Never come back!

917
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,840
Pull the plug.

918
01:45:42,875 --> 01:45:44,800
You can't do that!

919
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:06,880
<i>I was a warrior who
dreamed he could bring peace.</i>

920
01:46:08,200 --> 01:46:10,660
<i>Sooner or lather though...</i>

921
01:46:10,695 --> 01:46:13,120
<i>You always have to wake up.</i>

922
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:31,520
Monsters!

923
01:47:18,080 --> 01:47:20,480
What's going on brother,
long time no see.

924
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:25,680
Perosnaly I don't feel these tree hugging
traitors deserve steak.

925
01:47:25,720 --> 01:47:28,600
They got steak?
Bullshit, let me see that.

926
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,480
You know what that is, down.

927
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:35,200
Trudy, my God...

928
01:47:38,400 --> 01:47:41,200
Max!

929
01:47:49,600 --> 01:47:51,680
Trudy, fire up the ship.

930
01:47:52,720 --> 01:47:54,200
Here.

931
01:48:05,800 --> 01:48:07,920
Clear, come on.

932
01:48:07,955 --> 01:48:08,920
Here you go.

933
01:48:24,080 --> 01:48:25,680
Max, stay here.

934
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,400
I need someone on
the inside I can trust.

935
01:48:28,435 --> 01:48:29,920
Go.

936
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:44,720
Clear.

937
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,485
Come on baby.

938
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,600
Colonel, I got a situation.

939
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,600
Unauthorized engine start.

940
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:06,480
Come on!

941
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:09,680
Mask on!

942
01:49:14,320 --> 01:49:16,320
I'm taking fire, let's go!

943
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:39,920
Colonel!

944
01:49:51,800 --> 01:49:53,765
Crap.

945
01:49:53,800 --> 01:49:56,480
Everybody all right back there?
- Yeah baby.

946
01:49:56,520 --> 01:49:58,480
Norm, you good?
- Yeah.

947
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,320
This is gonna ruin my whole day.

948
01:50:02,355 --> 01:50:04,965
Grace is hit.
- What?

949
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:07,600
Get the trauma kit.
Keep the pressure on Grace.

950
01:50:07,635 --> 01:50:10,200
Trauma kit's forward,
on the bulk head.

951
01:50:10,235 --> 01:50:13,000
Hang on Grace.
- Doesn't matter.

952
01:50:13,600 --> 01:50:16,400
It's fine.

953
01:50:18,080 --> 01:50:21,280
Good to go?
- Take it up.

954
01:50:21,320 --> 01:50:23,320
Hold on.

955
01:50:27,920 --> 01:50:29,920
You're clear!

956
01:50:37,280 --> 01:50:40,320
Keep going north,
get us deep into the mountains.

957
01:50:40,355 --> 01:50:42,600
Copy that.

958
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,200
Norm, you all good up there?

959
01:50:50,235 --> 01:50:52,720
<i>Yup, still here.</i>

960
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:56,100
At least they can't
track us up here.

961
01:50:56,135 --> 01:50:58,365
Not this far into the vortex.

962
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,480
It's strongest at the
Tree of Souls, right?

963
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:02,860
Yeah.
- Good.

964
01:51:02,895 --> 01:51:05,200
Cos that's where we're going.

965
01:51:17,800 --> 01:51:20,080
Big cry baby.

966
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,285
Are we moving?

967
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:24,720
I'm gonna get you
some help Grace.

968
01:51:25,120 --> 01:51:28,320
I'm a scientist, remember?

969
01:51:28,355 --> 01:51:31,365
I don't believe in fairy tales.

970
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,600
People are gonna help
you, I know it.

971
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,200
Why would they help us?

972
01:51:55,120 --> 01:51:58,800
<i>The people say,
Eywa will provide.</i>

973
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:03,680
<i>But no home,
no hope...</i>

974
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:06,480
<i>There was only one
place they could go.</i>

975
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:24,000
Link's running, what's the plan Jake?

976
01:52:24,035 --> 01:52:26,480
There's no plan.

977
01:52:26,520 --> 01:52:28,880
Tsu'Tey is the chief now.

978
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:31,680
He's not gonna let
you near that place.

979
01:52:31,720 --> 01:52:34,200
I've got to try.

980
01:52:36,200 --> 01:52:38,200
Launching.

981
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:00,880
<i>Outcast...</i>

982
01:53:00,920 --> 01:53:03,280
<i>Betrayer...</i>

983
01:53:03,320 --> 01:53:05,280
<i>Alien...</i>

984
01:53:05,800 --> 01:53:09,000
<i>I was in the place,
the eye does not see.</i>

985
01:53:20,080 --> 01:53:22,340
<i>I needed their help.</i>

986
01:53:22,375 --> 01:53:24,565
<i>and they needed mine.</i>

987
01:53:24,600 --> 01:53:26,880
<i>But to ever face them again...</i>

988
01:53:26,920 --> 01:53:29,680
<i>I was gonna have to take
it to a whole new level.</i>

989
01:53:37,680 --> 01:53:41,120
<i>Sometimes your whole life
boils down to one insane move.</i>

990
01:53:43,800 --> 01:53:46,080
There's something we gotta do.

991
01:53:46,120 --> 01:53:48,800
You're not going to like it.

992
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:01,800
<i>The way I had it figured,
Turok is the badest cat in the sky.</i>

993
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:04,080
<i>Nothing attacks him.</i>

994
01:54:04,120 --> 01:54:05,765
Easy boy.

995
01:54:05,800 --> 01:54:08,400
<i>So why would he ever look up?</i>

996
01:54:08,435 --> 01:54:11,000
<i>That was just a theroy.</i>

997
01:56:02,320 --> 01:56:04,400
I see you.

998
01:56:06,480 --> 01:56:09,400
I see you.

999
01:56:16,600 --> 01:56:19,400
I was affraid Jake.

1000
01:56:19,435 --> 01:56:22,000
For my people.

1001
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:26,880
I'm not any more.

1002
01:56:34,880 --> 01:56:38,040
<i>Tsu'Tey, son of Ateyo...</i>

1003
01:56:38,075 --> 01:56:41,165
<i>I stand before you...</i>

1004
01:56:41,200 --> 01:56:44,800
<i>Ready to serve the
people of Omaticaya.</i>

1005
01:56:47,200 --> 01:56:49,565
You are the leader.

1006
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:52,000
And a great warrior.

1007
01:56:52,480 --> 01:56:54,800
I can't do this without you.

1008
01:57:01,280 --> 01:57:03,680
Toruk Makto.

1009
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:13,800
I will fly with you.

1010
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:18,720
My friend is dying.

1011
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:22,200
Grace is dying.

1012
01:57:23,520 --> 01:57:26,200
I beg the help of Eywa.

1013
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,400
Look where we are Grace.

1014
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:49,400
I need to take some samples.

1015
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:16,000
Great Mother may choose
to save all that she is...

1016
01:58:17,120 --> 01:58:19,600
In this body.

1017
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:22,880
Is that possible.

1018
01:58:22,920 --> 01:58:28,000
She must pass through the
eye of Eywa, and return.

1019
01:58:28,720 --> 01:58:30,880
But Jake Sully...

1020
01:58:30,920 --> 01:58:33,680
She is very weak.

1021
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:37,680
Hold on Grace,
they're gonna fix you up.

1022
01:58:41,000 --> 01:58:43,485
<i>Hear us our Mother.</i>

1023
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:46,080
<i>Eywa, the source of all energy...</i>

1024
01:58:46,120 --> 01:58:49,600
<i>Take this spirit...</i>

1025
01:58:51,920 --> 01:58:55,200
<i>and return it to us.</i>

1026
01:58:58,080 --> 01:59:01,000
<i>So it may live long</i>

1027
01:59:02,080 --> 01:59:04,080
<i>as a part of the people.</i>

1028
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:36,000
Jake...

1029
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,800
Grace...

1030
01:59:39,800 --> 01:59:42,080
I'm with her Jake.

1031
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,720
She's real.

1032
02:00:02,800 --> 02:00:04,800
Grace...

1033
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:08,200
What's happening?

1034
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:16,200
Did it work?

1035
02:00:20,880 --> 02:00:23,120
Her wound were to great.

1036
02:00:23,680 --> 02:00:25,400
It was not enough time.

1037
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,720
She is with Eywa now.

1038
02:01:02,080 --> 02:01:05,200
With your permission,
I will speak now.

1039
02:01:07,200 --> 02:01:09,520
You would honor me
by translating.

1040
02:01:16,720 --> 02:01:19,000
The sky people have
sent us a message...

1041
02:01:22,400 --> 02:01:24,880
That they can take
whatever they want.

1042
02:01:26,600 --> 02:01:28,880
And no one can stop them.

1043
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:34,480
But we will send them a message.

1044
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,720
You ride out as fast as
the wind can carry you.

1045
02:01:41,400 --> 02:01:43,920
We tell the other clans to come.

1046
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:50,080
You tell that Turok Makto
calls to them.

1047
02:01:52,080 --> 02:01:54,000
You fly now!

1048
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:55,960
With me!

1049
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,000
My brothers, sisters...

1050
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:02,080
And we will show the sky people.

1051
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:05,120
That they can not take
whatever they want!

1052
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:10,880
And that this,
this is our land!

1053
02:03:22,400 --> 02:03:24,880
<i>We rode out to the four winds...</i>

1054
02:03:26,720 --> 02:03:29,200
<i>To the horse clans of the plain...</i>

1055
02:03:33,400 --> 02:03:35,920
<i>To the Ikran people of
the eastern sea.</i>

1056
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,800
<i>When Turok Makto
called them, they came.</i>

1057
02:04:20,720 --> 02:04:26,320
Everyone on this base, everyone of you is
fighting for survival, and that's a fact.

1058
02:04:27,680 --> 02:04:30,800
There's aboriginal horde out there,
massing for an attack.

1059
02:04:34,080 --> 02:04:36,480
These orbital images tell me,

1060
02:04:36,720 --> 02:04:39,920
that the hostiles numbers have
gone from few hundred

1061
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,800
to well over two
thousand in one day.

1062
02:04:43,120 --> 02:04:45,600
And more are pouring in.

1063
02:04:47,520 --> 02:04:50,080
In a weeks time, there
could be 20.000 of them.

1064
02:04:51,000 --> 02:04:54,080
At that point they will
overrun our perimeter.

1065
02:04:54,200 --> 02:04:56,720
That's not gonna happen.

1066
02:04:57,200 --> 02:05:00,480
Our only security lies in
preemptive attack.

1067
02:05:00,880 --> 02:05:03,400
We will fight terror
with terror.

1068
02:05:07,600 --> 02:05:13,400
Hostiles believe that his mountain
stronghold of theirs is protected

1069
02:05:14,320 --> 02:05:16,600
by their deity.

1070
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,800
And when we destroy it...

1071
02:05:19,120 --> 02:05:21,920
We will blast a crater in their
racial memory so deep

1072
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,880
that hey won't come within a 1000
clicks of this place ever again.

1073
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:28,600
And that too, is a fact.

1074
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:44,240
<i>Jake it's crazy here, full mobilization.
They're rigging the shuttle as a bomber.</i>

1075
02:05:44,280 --> 02:05:47,680
<i>They got these huge
palettes of explosives</i>

1076
02:05:47,800 --> 02:05:49,920
<i>for some shock
and awe campaign.</i>

1077
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,080
Freakin daisy cutters.

1078
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:56,080
<i>Quaritch has taken over, he's
roaming and there's no stopping him.</i>

1079
02:05:56,120 --> 02:05:58,200
When?
- 06:00 tomorrow.

1080
02:05:58,320 --> 02:06:00,400
<i>I got to go.</i>

1081
02:06:02,400 --> 02:06:04,720
We're screwed.

1082
02:06:05,280 --> 02:06:09,000
And I was hoping for some sort of tactical
plan that didn't envolve martyrdom.

1083
02:06:11,280 --> 02:06:14,080
We're going up against gunships
with bows and arrows.

1084
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:19,520
I have 15 clans out there.

1085
02:06:20,480 --> 02:06:22,400
That's over 2000 warriors.

1086
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:27,520
We know these mountains.

1087
02:06:27,920 --> 02:06:29,280
They don't.

1088
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:33,280
Their instruments won't work up here,
missile tracking, won't work.

1089
02:06:34,080 --> 02:06:37,200
They'll have to fire a line of sight,
if they bring the fight to us...

1090
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:40,320
then we have the
home field advantage.

1091
02:06:41,800 --> 02:06:44,880
You know he's gonna commit
that bomber staight to the Tree of Souls.

1092
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,480
I know.

1093
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,880
If they get to it, it's over.

1094
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:53,000
That's their direct line to
Eywa, their ancestors.

1095
02:06:53,035 --> 02:06:55,165
It'll destroy them.

1096
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,680
Then I guess we better stop them.

1097
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:15,600
I'm probably just talking
to a tree right now.

1098
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,320
But if you're there...

1099
02:07:21,280 --> 02:07:23,600
I need to give you a heads up.

1100
02:07:25,280 --> 02:07:27,200
If Grace is with you...

1101
02:07:28,200 --> 02:07:30,720
Look into her memories.

1102
02:07:31,000 --> 02:07:33,520
See the world we come from.

1103
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:36,400
There's no green there.

1104
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:39,800
They killed their mother.

1105
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:42,600
And they're gonna
do the same here.

1106
02:07:44,400 --> 02:07:46,880
More sky people are gonna come.

1107
02:07:47,120 --> 02:07:49,600
They're gonna come like
rain that never ends.

1108
02:07:51,280 --> 02:07:53,600
Unless we stop them.

1109
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,600
You chose me for something.

1110
02:08:00,320 --> 02:08:02,480
I will stand and fight.

1111
02:08:03,200 --> 02:08:05,280
You know I will.

1112
02:08:07,280 --> 02:08:09,600
But I need a little help.

1113
02:08:15,680 --> 02:08:18,800
Our Great Mother does
not take sides Jake.

1114
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:23,680
She protects only the
balance of life.

1115
02:08:35,680 --> 02:08:38,000
It was worth a try.

1116
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:28,080
<i>This is group leader,
we're entering the flux vortex.</i>

1117
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:31,400
<i>Switch to manual flight mode.</i>

1118
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:09,880
This is papa dragon.

1119
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:13,000
I want this mission high and tight.
I want to be home for dinner.

1120
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:21,680
Suit team, go.

1121
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:24,200
<i>Alright ladies, let's bring the pain.</i>

1122
02:10:57,520 --> 02:10:59,520
Eyes up, check that overhead.

1123
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,720
Watch those thermal scans.

1124
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:05,120
<i>All call signs,
papa has lead.</i>

1125
02:11:05,155 --> 02:11:07,200
<i>Pushing the target.</i>

1126
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:09,400
<i>Escorts, be close on my shop.</i>

1127
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,800
We are gonna loose
some paint in here.

1128
02:11:17,200 --> 02:11:19,200
<i>Gun crews keep your head on the swip.</i>

1129
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,520
<i>Make no mistake people,
they're out there.</i>

1130
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,800
Alright people, target in sight.
Range four clicks.

1131
02:11:28,480 --> 02:11:31,000
Valkirye 1-6, get your payload ready.

1132
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:35,400
Push to the ramp!

1133
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:52,200
Hold position, we got
movement out there.

1134
02:11:52,240 --> 02:11:54,000
<i>Hold position.</i>

1135
02:12:01,000 --> 02:12:03,600
Sir, ground has movement.

1136
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:08,080
Fire in line!
- Targets closing.

1137
02:12:08,120 --> 02:12:10,000
Range 400 meters.

1138
02:12:10,400 --> 02:12:13,000
Can't you clean it up?
- No sir, it's the flux.

1139
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,600
Brother, I'm gonna punch
a hole, you follow me through.

1140
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:28,480
All aircrafts, weapons free.

1141
02:13:29,680 --> 02:13:31,600
Brake right, come around.

1142
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:45,800
Brake formation,
ingage all hostiles.

1143
02:14:33,800 --> 02:14:36,080
Scorpions, pursue and destroy.

1144
02:14:46,480 --> 02:14:48,480
Jake, Jake you copy?

1145
02:14:48,800 --> 02:14:51,000
We're falling back!
We're getting hammered!

1146
02:14:51,800 --> 02:14:53,200
Copy, get out of there.

1147
02:14:57,800 --> 02:14:59,520
That's him, get him!

1148
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:17,520
Take him out!

1149
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:27,920
Light her up!

1150
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:40,000
You're not the only
one with a gun bitch.

1151
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,000
Keep her in your sights!

1152
02:15:49,120 --> 02:15:50,200
That's it!

1153
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,800
Rogue 1 is hit!
I'm going in!

1154
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:30,720
Sorry Jake.

1155
02:17:38,600 --> 02:17:40,600
Fire.

1156
02:17:57,800 --> 02:18:00,400
Tsu'Tey, brother do you read?

1157
02:18:03,080 --> 02:18:05,080
Rogue 1, you copy?

1158
02:18:06,720 --> 02:18:08,200
Trudy?

1159
02:18:18,920 --> 02:18:22,800
Time to target, 2 minutes.
- Valkyrie 1-6, you are clear in hot.

1160
02:18:22,920 --> 02:18:25,400
Copy dragon, we are
starting our bomb run.

1161
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:33,520
Fire number one!

1162
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:35,400
Number one armed!

1163
02:18:36,320 --> 02:18:37,520
Jake!

1164
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:41,280
I read you!

1165
02:18:49,600 --> 02:18:51,680
<i>Neytiri.</i>

1166
02:18:52,200 --> 02:18:54,400
They are very close,
there are many.

1167
02:18:56,080 --> 02:18:58,165
Do not attack.

1168
02:18:58,200 --> 02:18:59,680
<i>Do you read me Neytiri?</i>

1169
02:19:02,600 --> 02:19:04,080
Do not attack!

1170
02:19:04,320 --> 02:19:07,600
<i>Fall back now, get out of there.
That's an order!</i>

1171
02:19:15,600 --> 02:19:17,400
Neytiri!

1172
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:20,480
<i>I've got movement.</i>

1173
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:22,200
Hold position.

1174
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:25,165
Something's coming.

1175
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:27,200
We've got movement,
200 meters.

1176
02:19:27,235 --> 02:19:29,080
Get ready.

1177
02:19:52,480 --> 02:19:54,480
Get out of here!

1178
02:19:55,680 --> 02:19:57,680
Fall back!

1179
02:20:06,920 --> 02:20:08,000
Jake!

1180
02:20:08,600 --> 02:20:10,800
Eywa has heard you.

1181
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:18,800
Eywa has heard you!

1182
02:21:08,920 --> 02:21:11,600
Sir, all escorts are
down or falling back.

1183
02:21:11,640 --> 02:21:13,800
Let's get this done.

1184
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:17,080
<i>Valkirye 1-6, this is dragon,
press the target.</i>

1185
02:21:17,600 --> 02:21:20,600
Copy, pressing the target.
Stand by to drop, 30 seconds.

1186
02:21:40,720 --> 02:21:43,200
On my mark,
2, 1, mark.

1187
02:21:43,240 --> 02:21:46,200
Drop!

1188
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:39,600
It's Sully!

1189
02:22:52,600 --> 02:22:55,000
Masks on!
- Breach alarm!

1190
02:25:31,920 --> 02:25:34,080
Come to papa.

1191
02:26:01,280 --> 02:26:03,600
Give it up Quaritch.

1192
02:26:06,000 --> 02:26:07,920
It's all over.

1193
02:26:08,800 --> 02:26:11,000
Nothing's over while I'm breathing.

1194
02:26:11,280 --> 02:26:13,520
I kinda hoped you'd say that.

1195
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:11,680
Come on!

1196
02:27:27,080 --> 02:27:31,080
Sully, how does it feel to
betray your own race?

1197
02:27:35,520 --> 02:27:37,800
You think you're
one of them?

1198
02:27:38,920 --> 02:27:41,400
Time to wake up.

1199
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:26,800
Jake!

1200
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:41,280
Jake...

1201
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,400
Jake...

1202
02:30:15,800 --> 02:30:17,920
Jake! My Jake!

1203
02:30:59,400 --> 02:31:01,920
I see you.

1204
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:09,080
I see you.

1205
02:31:19,200 --> 02:31:22,320
<i>The aliens went back
to their dying world.</i>

1206
02:31:24,320 --> 02:31:27,800
<i>Only a few were chosen to stay.</i>

1207
02:31:39,400 --> 02:31:42,920
<i>The time of Great Sorrow was ending.</i>

1208
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,080
<i>Toruk Makto was no longer needed.</i>

1209
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:03,800
<i>Well, I guess this is
my last video log.</i>

1210
02:32:04,720 --> 02:32:07,520
<i>Whatever happens tonight...</i>

1211
02:32:07,555 --> 02:32:10,685
<i>Either way, I'm not gonna</i>

1212
02:32:10,720 --> 02:32:13,920
<i>be coming back to this place.</i>

1213
02:32:15,920 --> 02:32:18,000
<i>Well I guess I better go.</i>

1214
02:32:20,720 --> 02:32:23,680
<i>I don't want to be late
for my own party.</i>

1215
02:32:27,080 --> 02:32:29,920
<i>It's my birthday after all.</i>

1216
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,400
<i>This is Jake Sully signing off.</i>
