1
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,904
My dear people,

2
00:01:35,284 --> 00:01:39,246
everyone is bound to feel that
our world is in a shocking mess.

3
00:01:39,658 --> 00:01:43,610
It may not be worse than in other times,
but it seems so to us.

4
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:47,074
And after all, our world is like us.

5
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:52,827
We're not lacking plans to make
a more decent and peaceful world,

6
00:01:53,908 --> 00:01:57,798
it's just that we don't have enough
good people to make our good plans work.

7
00:01:57,846 --> 00:02:01,736
<i>We must never relax for a single moment
in our work for a better world!</i>

8
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,071
<i>But the biggest and most helpful contribution
toward this that any of us can make...</i>

9
00:02:06,132 --> 00:02:07,735
<i>is for us to become...</i>

10
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,004
<i>better people.</i>

11
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:12,053
We must have more people
whose lives are motivated

12
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:15,565
by the kind of charity that St. Paul
wrote about long ago.

13
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,336
The kind that suffers long,

14
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,690
<i>the kind that thinks no evil,</i>

15
00:02:21,026 --> 00:02:25,121
<i>that kind that betters all things,
and endures all things.</i>

16
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:28,470
St. Paul said the charity tops
the list of all virtues.

17
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,062
Buddha, Muhammad, Confucius,

18
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,488
Moses and the Nazarene agree...

19
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:36,213
that the golden rule of doing for others

20
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,411
as we would have them do unto us

21
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:42,320
is fundamental in bringing peace
and happiness to individuals,

22
00:02:42,953 --> 00:02:44,939
and to our society.

23
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:47,207
All good people

24
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:50,609
have found gold in the golden rule.

25
00:02:50,847 --> 00:02:51,708
Amen!

26
00:02:53,029 --> 00:02:56,166
Mom, that lady is asleep.

27
00:02:56,757 --> 00:02:57,815
Boo!

28
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:01,903
One more time, and I'll take you out
and spank you. You look up there. Go ahead!

29
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:03,697
Behave yourself.

30
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:07,632
Mr. Clayton,

31
00:03:07,816 --> 00:03:09,198
one of the ushers took sick.

32
00:03:09,468 --> 00:03:12,343
Would you mind serving in his place?
- Not at all.

33
00:03:13,309 --> 00:03:14,325
Where are you going?

34
00:03:14,792 --> 00:03:16,552
They want me to help with the collection.

35
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:19,934
But you'll look silly.
You're too tall to take up collection.

36
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:21,814
Besides, you're so clumsy!

37
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,162
What's- Where's Daddy going?

38
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,115
He's going to help take up collection, dear.

39
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:31,683
Where's Daddy?

40
00:03:32,073 --> 00:03:33,905
He went to take up collection.

41
00:03:33,936 --> 00:03:36,929
Oh, I think that's something
to laugh at.

42
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:29,928
That was Daddy.

43
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:32,815
- I know, dear.
- Naturally, who else?

44
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:45,615
Good morning, Mr. Clayton.

45
00:04:59,404 --> 00:05:01,866
Hi, neighbors, going up in the snow?

46
00:05:02,087 --> 00:05:03,523
Nice day for it. Where are you going?

47
00:05:03,548 --> 00:05:05,843
No place. The car's broken down.

48
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:09,144
Oh that's too bad!
I'm sorry, Mrs. Butler.

49
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,861
And the children had their heart
set on it.

50
00:05:10,886 --> 00:05:13,009
And I don't get another day off in weeks.

51
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:15,482
Now I don't know what to do with
all this food.

52
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:18,901
Why don't you folks take it and go
some place and enjoy yourselves?

53
00:05:18,914 --> 00:05:19,853
No, thank you.

54
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:21,726
Oh, you're welcome, Mrs. Clayton.

55
00:05:21,902 --> 00:05:24,673
I've got the answer. It's very simple.
Take our car.

56
00:05:26,554 --> 00:05:28,742
- Thank you, Mrs. Clayton!
- Oh, sure.

57
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,405
Thanks, Mr. Clayton, thanks!

58
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,409
Isn't it great? They're tickled to death.

59
00:05:51,573 --> 00:05:52,973
Oh, Mr. Clayton.

60
00:05:53,026 --> 00:05:54,604
Would you call Nelson's garage?

61
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,917
It's in the book. Tell them
to come over and fix it.

62
00:05:56,977 --> 00:05:58,785
I'll need it in the morning for work.

63
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,389
- Nelson's garage?
- Yes.

64
00:06:00,589 --> 00:06:02,299
Sure. There.

65
00:06:03,304 --> 00:06:05,524
Oh, would you wipe the windshield, please?

66
00:06:05,645 --> 00:06:06,438
Sure.

67
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,248
Oh, that's good! I can see fine now.

68
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,980
Have you got everything in the car?

69
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:18,010
I forgot to feed the dog.

70
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:18,797
Oh, no!

71
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:20,637
Would you mind fixing him
a little dinner?

72
00:06:20,665 --> 00:06:23,089
- No.
- Have you any lean meat?

73
00:06:23,773 --> 00:06:25,665
Prince has such a weak stomach.

74
00:06:25,713 --> 00:06:27,649
Well, the markets are closed today,

75
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:30,097
but we're having sweet bread.
Very easy to digest.

76
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:31,401
- Pan-broiled?
- Aha.

77
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,923
And maybe a little cottage cheese?

78
00:06:32,948 --> 00:06:35,034
- Sure.
- Oh, that'll be fine.

79
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:37,209
Thank you, neighbors.

80
00:06:37,234 --> 00:06:38,797
That's very generous of you.

81
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:41,194
There should be more
people like you Claytons.

82
00:06:47,313 --> 00:06:50,744
You know... there should be less people
like the Butlers.

83
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:54,501
Incidentally, does it bother you that you
loaned the car to a man who can't see?

84
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,561
Well, I never thought of that.
But he's got good thick glasses.

85
00:07:03,247 --> 00:07:06,614
Well, maybe he's driving with
his reading glasses.

86
00:07:11,748 --> 00:07:13,648
- Morning, Lulu.
- Morning, Daddy.

87
00:07:13,673 --> 00:07:15,558
- Morning, Butch.
- Hiya, Pop.

88
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:17,045
Hat off...

89
00:07:22,045 --> 00:07:23,995
Please pass the Krispys.

90
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:27,616
Krispy Krunchies again, huh?
You've been eating those for two weeks.

91
00:07:27,756 --> 00:07:30,977
Only eleven more packages and
I'll get my Indian suit.

92
00:07:31,191 --> 00:07:33,463
Oh... and what's it that Lulu gets?

93
00:07:34,042 --> 00:07:36,316
She gets to see me in my Indian suit.

94
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:39,619
And then you said you'd help me get...
a doll.

95
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,458
Sure, after I get my football.

96
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:47,261
He gets always the best of it, Daddy.

97
00:07:47,647 --> 00:07:50,301
I eat everything, and he gets everything.

98
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,090
You shouldn't talk with your mouth full.

99
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,794
Say, Pop, isn't there something you can eat

100
00:07:55,819 --> 00:07:58,169
that can win mom a new house?

101
00:08:01,262 --> 00:08:03,711
Alright. You find out what it is,
and I'll eat it.

102
00:08:08,574 --> 00:08:09,536
What's so funny?

103
00:08:09,718 --> 00:08:12,362
- Your son just pulled a nifty.
- Oh, what was it?

104
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:14,359
Oh, just something between us men.

105
00:08:14,384 --> 00:08:15,141
Hey!

106
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:17,149
Where's Chloe?

107
00:08:17,186 --> 00:08:20,253
She must have missed the bus.
Monday's her bad morning anyway.

108
00:08:21,477 --> 00:08:24,761
Mm, it's a break for me.
I like this cook better anyway.

109
00:08:27,181 --> 00:08:28,663
Scrambled eggs and...

110
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:30,835
Canadian bacon...

111
00:08:31,212 --> 00:08:32,988
fries and scallop...

112
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,841
Oh, you're so talented.

113
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:36,947
You don't say it!

114
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:48,288
Please, Mr. Clayton,
my brother will be down any minute.

115
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:53,418
No, he won't. I called him, and he just...
rolled over and played dead.

116
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:55,324
Oh, did he?...

117
00:08:58,946 --> 00:09:03,260
- Do you suppose he'd mind if we ate?
- Beg your pardon?

118
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,581
Mommy, what are you and Daddy doing?

119
00:09:09,845 --> 00:09:10,930
Nothing!

120
00:09:13,222 --> 00:09:14,697
I'll be with you in a minute.

121
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:32,318
Here comes old sleepy-head.

122
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:35,727
Clever kid.

123
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,472
Morning, Claude.

124
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,731
Morning.

125
00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:40,911
Didn't you sleep?

126
00:09:40,936 --> 00:09:42,989
No. Bad night.

127
00:09:43,203 --> 00:09:44,683
Ready? Here's our breakfast.

128
00:09:48,043 --> 00:09:49,871
Well, here's yours...

129
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:53,237
and, uh... here's yours.

130
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,208
What did you do in the Navy,
have breakfast in bed?

131
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:02,049
Yeah...

132
00:10:02,826 --> 00:10:04,888
The Admiral used to bring me a tray.

133
00:10:05,353 --> 00:10:08,201
Claude, if it isn't asking too much,

134
00:10:08,226 --> 00:10:09,814
you are a guest in the house.

135
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:11,355
Not for long!

136
00:10:12,271 --> 00:10:15,082
Oh, I've realized six months
isn't a long time,

137
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:18,709
but while you are here the least you could do
is cooperate, and eat when we eat.

138
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:21,195
Couldn't you have gotten up earlier
this morning?

139
00:10:21,344 --> 00:10:23,955
What for? The labor office
doesn't open till ten.

140
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,250
Yeah, the government won't send
the cheque to the house,

141
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,726
he has to go all the way downtown
and stand in line.

142
00:10:29,124 --> 00:10:31,997
No! Does the government know this?

143
00:10:32,349 --> 00:10:34,671
I'll have to write my senator about it.

144
00:10:34,921 --> 00:10:37,956
Well, a fine way to talk
about your own brother.

145
00:10:38,272 --> 00:10:41,644
Oh, forgive me, Claude,
I didn't know what I was saying.

146
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:44,570
I've been standing over hot stove
all morning.

147
00:10:46,019 --> 00:10:47,658
Home on the range!

148
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:55,956
Uncle Claude?

149
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,884
Are you an idiot?

150
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,412
Somebody's been talking...

151
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,668
Now, you kids better get ready
for school now.

152
00:11:07,392 --> 00:11:09,842
Yes. Both of you, rush it.
Come on, scoot!

153
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,717
All right, get up!

154
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:14,292
Neither one of you will laugh when I'm rich!

155
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:16,263
Oh, the heck we won't!

156
00:11:18,635 --> 00:11:20,181
Lu, are you going to the funeral?

157
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,121
Whose funeral?

158
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,017
Oh, Lu. Poor Harry Gilmore.

159
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:31,847
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.
But I hardly knew Henry Gilmore.

160
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:32,754
Harry.

161
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:37,548
Was he the man who borrowed
the 180 dollars from the bank

162
00:11:37,574 --> 00:11:39,468
and you guaranteed payment?

163
00:11:40,996 --> 00:11:42,224
Yep, poor Harry.

164
00:11:42,782 --> 00:11:45,186
Did he leave the widow any...?

165
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:48,603
No. Sick a long time.
Very sad.

166
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,777
I'm sure he was a wonderful man,

167
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:55,043
but don't you think at times
you have too much faith in people?

168
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:58,240
Lu, how can you have
too much faith in people?

169
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,319
I know it sounds terrible,

170
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,055
but people imposed on you.

171
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:03,305
You're a soft touch.

172
00:12:03,934 --> 00:12:07,006
You always said you can picture you and me
by our own fireside.

173
00:12:07,334 --> 00:12:10,059
Well, 180 dollars would build
a pretty nice fireplace,

174
00:12:10,216 --> 00:12:12,086
in a home we're never going to get.

175
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:15,028
Look, Lu.
I don't regret it.

176
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,782
Harry Gilmore was a fine man.

177
00:12:19,686 --> 00:12:21,837
He happened to need some money,
and I saw that he got it.

178
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:22,724
Of course.

179
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:24,831
Everybody thinks well of Harry Gilmore.

180
00:12:25,218 --> 00:12:27,143
Say one thing wrong with Harry Gilmore.

181
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:28,684
His health!

182
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,651
Hey, she's got something there!

183
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:36,918
Say, can I have a cup of coffee
before you two go broke?

184
00:12:39,631 --> 00:12:41,383
Say, who can that be?

185
00:12:43,409 --> 00:12:44,857
Claude, would you mind if...?

186
00:12:44,905 --> 00:12:46,383
Why... no! Go ahead.

187
00:12:53,357 --> 00:12:55,456
Oh, the telephone. Claude...

188
00:12:56,822 --> 00:12:58,013
I've got it.

189
00:13:00,957 --> 00:13:01,972
Hello.

190
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:06,870
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

191
00:13:08,766 --> 00:13:09,816
Hello?

192
00:13:12,128 --> 00:13:15,439
Well, hello, Mr. Butler.
How are you?

193
00:13:16,887 --> 00:13:19,143
And your wife and the children?

194
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:24,999
Uh-huh.
And... how is our car?

195
00:13:27,262 --> 00:13:28,445
Well, that's good.

196
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:30,531
What?

197
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,453
Oh, you're staying another day.

198
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:37,632
Oh, it's alright, Mr. Butler.

199
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,190
Our children will get to school.
We'll manage somehow.

200
00:13:42,063 --> 00:13:43,931
Oh, think nothing of it!

201
00:13:44,014 --> 00:13:45,543
Sam will get to work.

202
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:48,561
That's alright.

203
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:50,819
What?

204
00:13:51,944 --> 00:13:54,181
Feed the dog? Again?

205
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:58,026
Uh-huh. And no canned food.

206
00:14:01,325 --> 00:14:04,120
Oh yes, I'll balance his
diet carefully.

207
00:14:05,426 --> 00:14:07,699
Well, have a good time!
By all means.

208
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,603
Lou, this is Mr. Nelson, the garage man.

209
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,277
Hello, Mr. Nelson!

210
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,663
He's gonna have a cup of coffee with us.

211
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:24,481
He is?

212
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:27,900
Oh, well, Mr. Nelson, sit right here.

213
00:14:29,027 --> 00:14:30,039
Take this.

214
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,250
Oh, here...

215
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:39,637
Oh, and... the Krunchies too, please.

216
00:14:41,847 --> 00:14:43,021
Thank you.

217
00:14:44,188 --> 00:14:46,877
Sam, what's Mr. Nelson doing here?

218
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:48,639
Oh, he fixed the Butlers' car.

219
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:52,633
- The brushes on the carburetor were fluctuating.
- You don't say!

220
00:14:55,605 --> 00:14:56,825
The Butlers' bill.

221
00:14:59,526 --> 00:15:00,212
Coffee?

222
00:15:00,237 --> 00:15:01,896
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah.

223
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,121
There you are.

224
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:21,399
You see, Mrs. Clayton, I run
my business on a cash basis.

225
00:15:21,424 --> 00:15:22,759
With me, cash is king,

226
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:24,768
why, if I trusted people
I'd starve to death.

227
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:26,716
You'd be surprised how many people
don't pay.

228
00:15:26,741 --> 00:15:27,821
Oh no, I wouldn't.

229
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,785
Oh, if you could measure
the number of deadbeats

230
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,875
there are in this world,
absolutely worthless, no good-

231
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,127
Have you met my brother Claude?

232
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:37,873
- Glad to know you.
- Charmed.

233
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,916
- Don't you think there's a lot in what I said?
- No, not much.

234
00:15:42,535 --> 00:15:44,452
Firstly, I think there's two sides
to everything,

235
00:15:44,496 --> 00:15:47,477
including my face,
which I'm now going to shave.

236
00:15:51,661 --> 00:15:53,648
Oh, he's only my half-brother.

237
00:15:55,365 --> 00:15:56,912
Well, that's nice.

238
00:15:57,049 --> 00:15:58,324
As I was telling Mr. Clayton,

239
00:15:58,349 --> 00:16:01,545
he's the one who called for my services,
and he's the one who should pay.

240
00:16:01,687 --> 00:16:04,055
But it isn't our car,
why should he have to pay the bill?

241
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,345
Well, the Butlers have been
our neighbors for a long while.

242
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,830
You can trust them.
They'll pay you, all right?

243
00:16:07,855 --> 00:16:11,725
If you can trust them so much, you pay me,
and they can pay you, or I'll take the car back.

244
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:15,482
Oh... Well, then I- I'll give you the money.

245
00:16:17,897 --> 00:16:19,986
5, 10, 15...

246
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:21,826
Oh, Sam, I forgot
to tell you.

247
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:24,407
The Butlers phoned and said
they're not bringing the car back.

248
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:27,514
They decided to stay another day.
The weather's so beautiful.

249
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,424
16, 17...
They did, huh?

250
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,041
18, 50, 75. Got any money, Lu?

251
00:16:42,263 --> 00:16:44,972
Well, no, I haven't.
I was expecting some of that.

252
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,035
Would you like to use
the children's lunch money?

253
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:48,943
Oh, Lu.

254
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:52,016
That's near enough.

255
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:54,419
He said that was near enough.

256
00:16:57,324 --> 00:17:00,656
Well, we're really in a fine fix now.

257
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,130
The kids will have to walk to school,
and I'll have to go with them.

258
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:05,450
- It's only six blocks.
- And six back.

259
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,310
And how are you going to get to work?

260
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:09,698
Unless you use the Butlers' car,
say, how about that?

261
00:17:10,034 --> 00:17:12,337
Well, I wouldn't think of using their car
without asking them.

262
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:14,261
No, you wouldn't...

263
00:17:15,981 --> 00:17:17,014
Well, I-

264
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:22,910
Sir, you brew a mighty fine bean.

265
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,776
Great coffee, sign of a great cook.

266
00:17:26,084 --> 00:17:27,217
She certainly is.

267
00:17:27,514 --> 00:17:29,170
She cooked me a wonderful breakfast.

268
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:33,089
Sure smells good.
Especially on an empty stomach.

269
00:17:33,454 --> 00:17:35,400
- Haven't you eaten yet?
- No...

270
00:17:35,816 --> 00:17:36,719
Lu.

271
00:17:39,889 --> 00:17:40,939
I've got it.

272
00:17:41,223 --> 00:17:44,399
Mr. Nelson, how would you like your eggs,
the same way?

273
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:47,378
Well, now that you ask,
thank you, ma'am, no.

274
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:49,625
Have you ever fixed them
with black butter?

275
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,225
- No.
- Well, you burn a little butter in the saucepan,

276
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:55,430
and you put the vinegar and the eggs
in a little casserole,

277
00:17:55,838 --> 00:18:00,354
and then you ta-... Of course there's always
eggs Florentine if you have fresh spinach.

278
00:18:00,482 --> 00:18:02,358
No, but we could plant some.

279
00:18:02,921 --> 00:18:04,428
No, that won't be necessary.

280
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:06,476
Eggs and black butter's quite a dish.

281
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:09,935
I'll bet if you tried it once,
your husband will want it all the time.

282
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:14,809
Incidentally, that's very funny,
what she said about planting the spinach.

283
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:18,153
<i>Your wife's got quite a sense of humor.</i>

284
00:18:18,713 --> 00:18:20,383
Yeah. Has yours?

285
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,205
No, she's got asthma.

286
00:18:23,192 --> 00:18:24,357
It's awful.

287
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,296
She's no fun at all.

288
00:18:28,724 --> 00:18:30,838
I bet you have a picnic with her!

289
00:18:32,075 --> 00:18:34,588
Oh, yeah, she's a barrel of fun.

290
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:38,658
I'll fix your eggs, Mr. Nelson.

291
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,887
You certainly did alright for yourself.

292
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:45,515
Now, you take my wife...

293
00:18:45,889 --> 00:18:49,133
I don't know, she's...
she's got a kind of a horse face.

294
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:53,765
Oh, Mr. Nelson, I've seen some
mighty pretty horses.

295
00:18:54,828 --> 00:18:57,404
- I had a beautiful big horse.
- My wife's big too.

296
00:18:59,261 --> 00:19:00,145
His name was Baldy.

297
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:04,072
Say, that's funny. She's getting a little
bald spot too, right on top.

298
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:06,399
I'm gonna start calling her Baldy.

299
00:19:07,016 --> 00:19:08,036
No...

300
00:19:08,768 --> 00:19:12,755
No, I guess I better not. I gotta watch
I don't get too funny, on account of her asthma.

301
00:19:13,305 --> 00:19:15,973
It gets her to laughing,
and it gets her to wheezing.

302
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,753
Sometimes she sounds like a whistle.

303
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,767
Sometimes she sounds like a foghorn.

304
00:19:37,378 --> 00:19:39,228
My wife's grandmother had the same trouble.

305
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:40,595
She looked like a horse, huh?

306
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,629
No, just... just asthma.

307
00:19:46,641 --> 00:19:48,980
- Morning, miss Lou.
- Hello, Chloe.

308
00:19:49,061 --> 00:19:52,000
I just missed the bus.
Waiting for the streetcar.

309
00:19:52,352 --> 00:19:56,277
Oh, that man of mine!
This no-good little casino.

310
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,597
Did you have trouble
getting him up this morning?

311
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:02,400
Gettin' 'im up? No, he didn't come
home at all, that little fool.

312
00:20:02,495 --> 00:20:04,886
He thinks he has found a new
Linda Horn.

313
00:20:05,226 --> 00:20:06,749
All she is is lean...

314
00:20:06,952 --> 00:20:10,206
What she's got I ain't got twice as much of?

315
00:20:11,035 --> 00:20:12,809
I take over, Mrs. Lou.

316
00:20:13,132 --> 00:20:14,890
Who are we feeding?
Brother Claude?

317
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,103
Well, look-

318
00:20:16,375 --> 00:20:17,733
See here, who's that?

319
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:20,279
Mr. Sam asked him to move in too?

320
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,670
I'm quitting! Yes, sir, I cer-

321
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,309
He's just here for breakfast.

322
00:20:29,627 --> 00:20:30,903
Miss Lu...

323
00:20:31,384 --> 00:20:34,312
How does Mr. Sam find
to find all these characters?

324
00:20:34,596 --> 00:20:37,513
I've tried to break him of it, Chloe,
but he just loves people.

325
00:20:38,355 --> 00:20:39,388
Yes, miss...

326
00:20:39,741 --> 00:20:43,677
My man loves people too,
but he loves them off the premises.

327
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,995
How does this one want his eggs?

328
00:20:46,694 --> 00:20:48,189
On black butter.

329
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:51,628
No foolin'? Black butter?

330
00:20:58,563 --> 00:21:02,495
Black butter! I got to take
another look at that...

331
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:07,145
- Morning, Mr. Clayton!
- Morning, Chloe.

332
00:21:07,216 --> 00:21:09,978
- Morning.
- Morning... Good morning.

333
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,927
And don't forget, take his eggs off
in exactly 33 seconds.

334
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:25,722
Lu, his wife has asthma, bad.

335
00:21:26,164 --> 00:21:28,343
She has? Oh, I'm sorry.

336
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:32,125
Yeah... she's a mess!

337
00:21:34,845 --> 00:21:36,745
You oughta see what I go through...

338
00:21:41,775 --> 00:21:43,546
His wife has asthma.

339
00:21:43,955 --> 00:21:45,253
Is it contagious?

340
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:50,021
Hey, Lu, what are we gonna do
about his poor wife's asthma?

341
00:21:50,258 --> 00:21:52,552
Well, I don't know, Sam,
but I'll work on it.

342
00:21:52,832 --> 00:21:55,699
I'll write to Johns Hopkins
and buy a medical journal.

343
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:57,308
No, no, Lu...

344
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,859
I mean that goose grease remedy
of your grandmother.

345
00:22:00,464 --> 00:22:02,043
It helped Buch's croup a lot.

346
00:22:02,591 --> 00:22:04,932
Couldn't you make a little batch of it
for Mrs. Nelson?

347
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:06,393
Sam...

348
00:22:06,961 --> 00:22:09,264
That takes four hours.
It's Monday.

349
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:10,488
Chloe and I have-

350
00:22:10,513 --> 00:22:12,116
I can come back later.
No bother.

351
00:22:15,198 --> 00:22:16,746
I got a hunch it will help her a lot.

352
00:22:16,771 --> 00:22:19,183
She can't go through life
sounding like a foghorn.

353
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,723
<i>Oh, it'd be a blessing if you
could cure her...</i>

354
00:22:21,953 --> 00:22:23,643
All right, all right.
I'm sold.

355
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,123
Come on, kids. It's almost nine.

356
00:22:26,228 --> 00:22:29,090
Mother'll take you.
Sam, you better get going too.

357
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:34,772
Well, I always say one good turn
deserves another,

358
00:22:34,797 --> 00:22:37,676
I'd like to drop your children off at school,
and take you on to work.

359
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:39,369
Thank you. Did you hear that, Lu?

360
00:22:39,569 --> 00:22:41,405
Mr. Nelson is gonna drop us off in his car.

361
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,225
Oh, that's very nice of you,
Mr. Nelson.

362
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,689
Yeah, bread up on the water, as I always say.

363
00:22:46,023 --> 00:22:47,775
I'll be back for the goose grease.

364
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,662
Goodbye, little mother.

365
00:22:48,687 --> 00:22:51,630
- Around lunchtime?
- A little later, about three.

366
00:23:02,276 --> 00:23:03,937
Oh, no!

367
00:23:06,721 --> 00:23:09,700
Chloe, Chloe! Come here,
you gotta see this.

368
00:23:11,227 --> 00:23:12,609
There you go.

369
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:15,319
They're so cute.

370
00:23:15,964 --> 00:23:17,886
- Bye!
- Bye!

371
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:21,773
Be careful!

372
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:31,080
Imagine, the general manager
of our leading department store!

373
00:23:31,105 --> 00:23:32,632
He doesn't care.

374
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:39,581
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Good morning. How are you?

375
00:23:41,594 --> 00:23:43,459
- Well, Mrs. Kelly, hello.
- Hello.

376
00:23:44,152 --> 00:23:46,278
Say, how is that little baby of yours?

377
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,752
- Oh, he's just fine.
- Wonderful.

378
00:23:49,478 --> 00:23:50,485
Remember her?

379
00:23:51,086 --> 00:23:52,517
- Finnerty?
- Yes.

380
00:23:54,276 --> 00:23:56,226
Of course, we've met
at your baby's christening.

381
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,697
Say, and how many teeth does he have now?

382
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,444
He has five.
Three upper, two lower.

383
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:04,997
Five teeth altogether?
Three upper and two lower?

384
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,803
Yes.

385
00:24:07,693 --> 00:24:09,976
Hey, her ba-
Oh, I beg your pardon.

386
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:12,907
Mr. H.C. Borden, our president.
Mrs. Kelly and Mrs. Finnerty.

387
00:24:12,932 --> 00:24:14,547
Oh, how do you do, I'm delighted.

388
00:24:14,637 --> 00:24:15,484
How do you do, Mr. Borden.

389
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:19,183
Her baby has five teeth already,
and he's not more than... What? Eight?

390
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,689
- Eight months old.
- Eight months old.

391
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:24,248
And her boy will be graduating
from military academy in...

392
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,424
June?

393
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:28,013
Why, that's right, Mr. Clayton!

394
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:30,230
Isn't that wonderful?
Such a memory!

395
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:33,550
And he's a great big fellow too.
Why, he's that much taller than you are.

396
00:24:34,714 --> 00:24:35,914
Well, well...

397
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:38,173
Uh, what can I do for you?

398
00:24:38,198 --> 00:24:40,361
- Well, uh...
- I'd like to see something in teething range.

399
00:24:40,386 --> 00:24:41,787
Teething range?

400
00:24:42,173 --> 00:24:44,150
- Oh, yes... For the little fellow?
- Yes.

401
00:24:44,167 --> 00:24:44,937
Of course.

402
00:24:44,962 --> 00:24:46,370
Upstairs please, the third floor,

403
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:49,569
and the first counter on the right
as you come out of the elevator.

404
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:50,470
Sam!

405
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:52,424
- ... to miss Harrington.
- Thank you!
- All right!

406
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,527
Why didn't you escort them up
personally?

407
00:24:55,356 --> 00:24:57,416
It's not every day we sell
a teething ring. No.

408
00:24:57,736 --> 00:24:59,639
Now, Sam, this is our biggest season, so...

409
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:03,033
don't waste time getting people's names
and how many teeth the baby has.

410
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:05,136
Well, we wait all year for Christmas!

411
00:25:05,364 --> 00:25:09,166
You can have the other eleven months,
but give me that Yuletide season.

412
00:25:10,392 --> 00:25:12,469
You know, Sam, when sentiment runs high,

413
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:14,066
that's the time to make the kill.

414
00:25:14,671 --> 00:25:17,692
So keep your eyes peeled for confused
fathers and husbands.

415
00:25:17,774 --> 00:25:18,908
They'll buy anything.

416
00:25:18,933 --> 00:25:20,467
And it's our job to see that they get it.

417
00:25:20,492 --> 00:25:21,953
- Excuse me.
- This is the ti-

418
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,066
Can you tell me where
Humboldt Street is?

419
00:25:24,145 --> 00:25:27,200
822 1/2 Humboldt Street.
This is near Claremont.

420
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:29,689
There's a city directory over there
by the phone booth, madam.

421
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:31,872
You know Sam, we can't milk Easter very much.

422
00:25:31,986 --> 00:25:35,552
Father's Day's all right, moving neckties,
but for Christmas, ha, ha!

423
00:25:36,349 --> 00:25:37,812
I'll have you know I broke my glasses,

424
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:40,150
and it wouldn't do me any good
to look it up in your old directory.

425
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:41,801
Can I be of any help?

426
00:25:41,982 --> 00:25:45,334
Yes, I can see that your mother
taught you manners.

427
00:25:45,985 --> 00:25:47,527
I'm an orphan myself.

428
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:49,575
Are you acquainted with our city?

429
00:25:50,253 --> 00:25:53,253
No, I just came in on the train.
That's how I broke my glasses.

430
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:55,997
I was in the dining
car, and we hit a curve...

431
00:25:56,411 --> 00:25:58,739
There they went! They smashed...

432
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:02,628
Well, that's too bad. Well, that's about
eleven blocks from here,

433
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:06,580
Let's see. This is Main, go down Main
five blocks to Elm,

434
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,454
one short block to the right
will bring you to Sycamore...

435
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:11,812
Oh, dear... That's too many streets.

436
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,995
Or maybe this will help you.

437
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:16,247
Here we are,

438
00:26:16,614 --> 00:26:18,600
right here, five blocks down Main... Elm...
- Yes...

439
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,540
Now be careful at this intersection,
it's very dangerous.

440
00:26:25,494 --> 00:26:27,196
- Five blocks...
- Yes, let me look at that...

441
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,703
...to Humboldt.

442
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:32,886
- Now, right about here is 822.
- And I'll find the house!

443
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:34,909
I bet you will.

444
00:26:35,936 --> 00:26:37,460
That's very nice of you.

445
00:26:37,868 --> 00:26:41,601
If I can't get this, really, I-
I oughta have my head examined, hadn't I?

446
00:26:42,984 --> 00:26:43,994
Good bye.

447
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:46,568
Sam, I want to talk to you.

448
00:26:46,593 --> 00:26:48,354
Up to now, you've solved the teething lady,

449
00:26:48,397 --> 00:26:50,807
you've drawn a map showing people
how to get to Humboldt Street.

450
00:26:51,142 --> 00:26:53,255
Personally, I'd rather hear
the cash register ring.

451
00:26:53,307 --> 00:26:55,968
Well, maybe they'll be back some day
and make your cash register ring.

452
00:26:55,993 --> 00:26:58,100
Sam, you and I don't see
eye to eye on anything.

453
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:02,045
You told all the department heads they can take
two hours off to go to Harry Gilmore's funeral.

454
00:27:02,146 --> 00:27:03,454
It's bad enough that I have to go.

455
00:27:03,509 --> 00:27:05,742
He was your advertising manager
for thirty years.

456
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:07,134
I paid him for thirty years.

457
00:27:07,254 --> 00:27:09,888
If they want to make a big thing out of it,
why don't they bury him at night?

458
00:27:10,014 --> 00:27:12,058
Then everybody could go on their own time.

459
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:14,242
Hey, how about that?

460
00:27:14,307 --> 00:27:16,688
People are born at night, people die at
night ...

461
00:27:16,821 --> 00:27:18,354
They even play night baseball,
don't they?

462
00:27:18,379 --> 00:27:20,294
But you just don't bury people at night.

463
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:23,126
- Well, they shouldn't bury them on my time, then...
- I beg your pardon.

464
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,527
May I have a free sample
of your new cold cream

465
00:27:25,552 --> 00:27:27,876
that you're advertising and demonstrating?

466
00:27:28,233 --> 00:27:30,355
There's your man. He'll direct you.

467
00:27:30,939 --> 00:27:32,495
- We'll take the elevator.
- Thank you.

468
00:27:36,556 --> 00:27:37,647
Here I am again.

469
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,481
What's the matter, did you lose the map?

470
00:27:39,581 --> 00:27:43,207
No, I was just walking along,
and I got to thinking...

471
00:27:45,401 --> 00:27:46,500
Hello there.

472
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:49,498
I was just telling one of your clerks here
that I was walking along...

473
00:27:49,523 --> 00:27:52,095
This is Mr. H.C. Borden,
our president.

474
00:27:52,329 --> 00:27:55,041
- How do you do?
- President? He?

475
00:27:55,287 --> 00:27:56,160
Not...?

476
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,160
Oh! I thought you were president.

477
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,019
Well, anyway...

478
00:28:10,706 --> 00:28:12,982
You were so sweet about
telling me all those directions,

479
00:28:13,007 --> 00:28:14,655
I remembered something I needed.

480
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,694
And I thought... why not buy it
from that nice young man?

481
00:28:18,052 --> 00:28:20,774
Well, I'm sure that whatever it is you want, we have.

482
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:22,933
What did you have in mind?

483
00:28:23,005 --> 00:28:24,859
Have you any knitting needles?

484
00:28:27,865 --> 00:28:30,235
What kind? Steel or bone?
And... what kind of yarn?

485
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,507
Oh, I wouldn't know.
You see, I'm just taking it up.

486
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:35,527
I have a granddaughter.

487
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:37,184
Don't tell me you're a grandmother!

488
00:28:37,209 --> 00:28:39,504
Stop it, you fool!
She's going to be married.

489
00:28:39,753 --> 00:28:41,704
She's going to marry the nicest young man,

490
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,585
and... I'm gonna be alone
a great deal from now on.

491
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:46,646
So I thought I'd take up knitting.

492
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:52,504
Well, what do you intend to knit, a sock,
or... perhaps a hug-me-tight, huh?

493
00:28:53,793 --> 00:28:56,321
I had in mind, uh... a turtleneck sweater.

494
00:28:56,581 --> 00:28:57,924
For a giraffe!

495
00:29:07,018 --> 00:29:09,685
Well, seriously, what would you like to knit?

496
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:13,477
I thought I'd like to start on those
Argyle socks that everybody's knitting.

497
00:29:13,631 --> 00:29:16,225
Well, Argyles are a little tricky
to begin with...

498
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:19,477
First, of course, you'll have to learn
how to knit and pearl.

499
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,862
That's the basis.
That's where you have to start.

500
00:29:22,107 --> 00:29:24,688
- But... we give lessons.
- And they're free!

501
00:29:27,319 --> 00:29:30,973
Couldn't she just use our needles until
she decides whether she likes it or not?

502
00:29:31,453 --> 00:29:33,437
Oh, I'll buy them.

503
00:29:33,878 --> 00:29:35,411
And speaking of buying...

504
00:29:35,958 --> 00:29:39,125
I plan to buy Johnny and Rhoda
a wedding present in Chillicothe,

505
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,479
and ship it here to them.

506
00:29:40,532 --> 00:29:43,305
But if I bought it here, it'd save
all that freight, wouldn't it?

507
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,252
Yes, it would.

508
00:29:44,484 --> 00:29:48,267
I believe in giving things to people
when they're young, don't you?

509
00:29:50,422 --> 00:29:52,394
So I'm furnishing their house complete.

510
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:56,963
With everything. Stove,
refrigerator, washing machine,

511
00:29:56,988 --> 00:29:59,071
silverware, linen, just everything.

512
00:29:59,137 --> 00:30:02,699
And- And I'll need your help, to remind me
in case I forget anything.

513
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:06,321
It'll cost several thousand dollars,
but they're young!

514
00:30:08,102 --> 00:30:10,629
It'll certainly make Rhoda and Johnny
very happy.

515
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:13,896
You know, Johnny's name's Camel.
This is gonna be very funny.

516
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:17,071
When Rhoda marries him, she
will be Rhoda Camel <i>(rode a camel)</i>!

517
00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:19,277
Camel? Get it?

518
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:23,516
He doesn't get it.

519
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:25,387
What's that?

520
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:28,189
Phi Beta Kappa?
You don't think it's funny?

521
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:31,506
You know, sometimes I wander...

522
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,988
- Where is the furniture department?
- Furniture?

523
00:31:04,037 --> 00:31:05,477
Thank you so much!

524
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:11,252
Haven't got all day, you know,
I'm running on a schedule!

525
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:14,401
You might run it with a little courtesy too.

526
00:31:18,299 --> 00:31:20,055
You know, if it hadn't been for you, mister,

527
00:31:21,139 --> 00:31:24,353
he'd have waited until I got just in front of the bus, and...

528
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:26,169
then run over me.

529
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,432
Wouldn't have been a bad idea at that.

530
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:31,475
What's all the hurry these days?

531
00:31:32,026 --> 00:31:33,701
Where's everybody going?

532
00:31:35,541 --> 00:31:38,841
Absolutely no consideration
for anybody else.

533
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:45,185
That's why it's a pleasure
to meet a person like you.

534
00:31:51,811 --> 00:31:55,244
I would've had to wait twenty minutes for another bus,

535
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:57,941
and I have a dentist appointment.

536
00:31:57,973 --> 00:32:00,671
And you know how hard it is
to get them these days.

537
00:32:00,696 --> 00:32:01,662
Oh, yes.

538
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:06,420
You know, none of us go
to the dentist often enough.

539
00:32:06,846 --> 00:32:10,673
And don't let anyone ever tell you
to have your wisdom teeth out.

540
00:32:11,139 --> 00:32:14,348
Because if I didn't have my wisdom teeth...

541
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,466
he wouldn't have had anything to bridge to!

542
00:32:18,051 --> 00:32:19,044
See?

543
00:32:19,783 --> 00:32:22,357
That's the one. And this!
You get what I mean?

544
00:32:24,424 --> 00:32:26,646
I can't begin to thank you!

545
00:32:27,377 --> 00:32:29,840
Thank goodness for people like you.

546
00:32:33,275 --> 00:32:36,800
Most people are so...
thoughtless and rude these days.

547
00:32:37,787 --> 00:32:40,443
I was telling my husband, only the other day...

548
00:32:40,741 --> 00:32:43,736
I bet he gets cauliflower ears
from listening to her.

549
00:32:46,108 --> 00:32:48,465
You're paid to run the bus,

550
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:51,108
not to insult the passengers.

551
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:54,614
It all started with Sir Galahad here

552
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,934
stopping the bus,
making a hero out of himself.

553
00:32:57,746 --> 00:32:59,453
Don't lose your temper, mister.

554
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:02,512
It takes all kinds of people
to make a world.

555
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:05,189
From a distance, he must have
thought she was pretty.

556
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,867
For that, I'll have to report him.

557
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,466
What's your number?

558
00:33:14,977 --> 00:33:17,654
Here's the whole description,
take it all down.

559
00:33:18,034 --> 00:33:20,224
Just as I thought!

560
00:33:21,264 --> 00:33:22,988
No hair!

561
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:27,509
I'm not surprised!

562
00:33:27,614 --> 00:33:30,774
Nothing could grow on a head like that!
- Oh, you...

563
00:33:34,026 --> 00:33:36,670
Here it is, all in his hat.

564
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,481
Melvin Z. Wurtzberger.

565
00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:44,725
Melvin Z. Wurtzberger!

566
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:54,759
You know, it's really
people like you, mister...

567
00:33:54,815 --> 00:33:55,860
- Yes, you've said that before.
- ... that restore...

568
00:33:55,885 --> 00:33:57,651
Would you let me off at
the next corner, please?

569
00:33:57,723 --> 00:34:00,261
Why, just stick around, Bob,
maybe she'll bake you a cake?

570
00:34:01,321 --> 00:34:04,169
Why don't you shut that
big fresh face of yours?

571
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:14,854
Don't worry, this is his last day
with the railroad company.

572
00:34:53,578 --> 00:34:54,865
I'm sorry!

573
00:34:55,525 --> 00:34:56,398
What was I to think?

574
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:59,870
She was running there very fast.
I thought she wanted to get in the bus.

575
00:35:00,227 --> 00:35:02,222
Well, look, don't get-

576
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:07,175
Melvin's same words...

577
00:35:32,729 --> 00:35:34,300
- Morning, Ruthie.
- Morning, Mr. Clayton.

578
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:35,861
I like this department.

579
00:36:32,145 --> 00:36:33,772
It's a wonderful number!

580
00:36:34,127 --> 00:36:35,628
Shirley May is feeling better.

581
00:36:36,637 --> 00:36:37,673
Worse.

582
00:36:38,352 --> 00:36:39,656
She seems to be jumping...

583
00:36:39,681 --> 00:36:41,223
Yes, she's jumping all right.

584
00:36:41,776 --> 00:36:44,258
Her next jump will be off a bridge,
mark my words.

585
00:36:44,635 --> 00:36:48,314
She's got those "when I woke up this morning,
he was gone" blues.

586
00:36:48,504 --> 00:36:50,578
I was out with them half a dozen times.

587
00:36:50,724 --> 00:36:53,178
And he even told me
he was going to marry her.

588
00:36:54,409 --> 00:36:56,332
The yellow so-and-so...

589
00:36:56,372 --> 00:36:58,819
Didn't have nerve enough
to tell it to her himself.

590
00:36:59,002 --> 00:37:02,882
He wrote to the landlady, and she gave
Shirley May the news with her eviction notice.

591
00:37:02,998 --> 00:37:04,540
- That's rough.
- Yeah...

592
00:37:05,508 --> 00:37:08,142
I'd take her in myself, Mr. Clayton,
you know that,

593
00:37:08,482 --> 00:37:11,251
but my husband, the kid and myself
are all in one room.

594
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:14,892
It's pretty crowded, you know,
you were at the wedding reception, remember?

595
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:20,182
If she doesn't get a break, you're going
to be reading about her in the newspapers.

596
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:26,866
Number one on the Hit Parade
in a month, I guarantee.

597
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:29,273
Shirley May, may I speak to you?

598
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:31,599
Ruth, will you take over from there?

599
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:38,252
Well... you've made a lot of sales already,

600
00:37:38,277 --> 00:37:40,555
I'm gonna make a note
to get you a little raise.

601
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:42,824
Oh, but I'm quitting, Mr. Clayton.

602
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:44,992
- You're quitting?
- Yes.

603
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:47,619
Well you are... Sit down.

604
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:53,585
You know, your department has done
wonderfully since you took over.

605
00:37:53,978 --> 00:37:55,081
Why quit?

606
00:37:55,692 --> 00:37:57,952
Because I can't stand it anymore,
Mr. Clayton.

607
00:37:58,866 --> 00:38:00,639
Singing those songs gets me down, I-

608
00:38:00,664 --> 00:38:01,714
Now look...

609
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:05,597
You've got only one problem.
Where are you gonna sleep tonight?

610
00:38:05,792 --> 00:38:07,261
Now, I'm gonna give you
the rest of the day off,

611
00:38:07,286 --> 00:38:09,887
and you're going out and try
to find yourself a place to stay.

612
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:11,928
If you don't have any luck,

613
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:14,768
give me a call, and I'll try
to find you something.

614
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:20,051
You're too young and too... pretty and...
- Oh, sure.

615
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:24,097
You're attractive enough to get a single man!

616
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:26,965
Here.

617
00:38:28,051 --> 00:38:29,429
Put on a new face.

618
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,572
Start a new life, hmm?

619
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,954
Nice people, the Claytons.

620
00:38:47,945 --> 00:38:50,515
Oh, Mr. Nelson!
How are you?

621
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:52,416
And this is Mrs. Nelson,
I take it.

622
00:38:52,441 --> 00:38:53,814
Yeah, this is her.

623
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,778
Well, we just came by to congratulate you.

624
00:38:55,803 --> 00:38:58,238
That goose grease of yours
did the trick, Mrs. Clayton.

625
00:38:58,507 --> 00:38:59,735
Helped her a lot.

626
00:39:00,157 --> 00:39:01,730
I'm sure grateful to you, Mrs. Clayton.

627
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:03,616
Well, we just stopped by to return your jar.

628
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,769
I filled it with some of my special
meat sauce.

629
00:39:05,837 --> 00:39:09,108
Oh, you shouldn't have done that!
It's very nice of you.

630
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,700
Well...

631
00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:11,627
Thanks.

632
00:39:13,807 --> 00:39:18,621
I hope we didn't come at the wrong time.
You're in dinner hour, I think, like that...

633
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:21,622
I'd, uh... I'd  like to invite you
to stay the dinner ...

634
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:22,132
Alright.

635
00:39:22,157 --> 00:39:26,374
I mean, if we had, uh... But you
couldn't've picked a worse evening.

636
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,323
We just have a little sort of a... a...
it's nothing really.

637
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,152
Chloe says "come and get it".

638
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:36,519
That roast beef, that Yorkshire pudding
and then golden-brown potatoes are awaiting!

639
00:39:37,343 --> 00:39:38,222
Lu?

640
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,823
- Oh, hello, Mr. Nelson.
- Glad to see you, Mr. Clayton.

641
00:39:42,159 --> 00:39:43,882
- And this is...?
- Yeah.

642
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,317
This is the missus, the one
I was telling you about.

643
00:39:46,377 --> 00:39:47,504
Well, hello.

644
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:50,522
Well, uh... thanks again.

645
00:39:50,547 --> 00:39:54,847
That meat sauce of ours will go
wonderful on... your roast beef.

646
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:01,125
Well, uh... say, Claude won't be here tonight...

647
00:40:01,213 --> 00:40:03,597
That's what I say, Sam.
Won't you come in?

648
00:40:03,622 --> 00:40:05,475
Well, we can't stay long, but just...

649
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,603
Chloe!

650
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:12,845
Now, everybody just my meat sauce,
tell me how you like it.

651
00:40:26,198 --> 00:40:29,038
Is that the same jar the goose grease was in?

652
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,463
Don't worry, little man.
I scoured it thoroughly with soap and water!

653
00:40:38,957 --> 00:40:42,480
I quite agree. I can still taste the soap!

654
00:40:44,385 --> 00:40:45,475
Butch!

655
00:40:50,242 --> 00:40:51,841
It's very tasty.

656
00:40:52,308 --> 00:40:54,348
What do you put in it, Mrs. Nelson?

657
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:56,550
Well, first...

658
00:40:56,727 --> 00:40:58,763
I know. Soap!

659
00:41:00,648 --> 00:41:01,714
Butch!

660
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,887
Come on, kids, let's go to the kitchen.

661
00:41:12,142 --> 00:41:15,084
- Vegetables, or...?
- Oh, sorry.

662
00:41:17,416 --> 00:41:19,516
They're gonna have their dinner
in here, Chloe.

663
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,047
I thought so...

664
00:41:23,024 --> 00:41:26,639
Now, I want you two to finish your dinner
without a peep out of either one of you.

665
00:41:29,172 --> 00:41:31,165
Chloe, let me know if they don't behave,
will you?

666
00:41:31,249 --> 00:41:32,390
Yes sir.

667
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,925
Oh, Sam, Mr. Nelson is just saying
his wife sells real estate.

668
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,994
Well, do you think this would be
a good time to buy, Mrs. Nelson?

669
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:47,652
Well, mark my word, prices won't be
any lower in our time.

670
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:53,424
Would you be willing to trade this house in?

671
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,483
We don't own it.

672
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,111
You don't own your own home,
a man in your position?

673
00:42:00,463 --> 00:42:01,376
Clayton...

674
00:42:01,946 --> 00:42:05,336
If the price was right, what type of a home
would you be interested in?

675
00:42:05,543 --> 00:42:09,764
Well, I've always had my heart set on
an early American farmhouse style.

676
00:42:10,374 --> 00:42:14,215
Well, there is one...
It's not on the market yet.

677
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:17,986
The owner built it himself, he's an architect
and he may go to South America.

678
00:42:19,373 --> 00:42:21,911
And she brought all her own furniture
from Connecticut.

679
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:22,830
Oh, no!

680
00:42:23,085 --> 00:42:25,277
It sounds just like my dream home!

681
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:29,090
Look.

682
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:32,583
- This!
- Well, look at that...

683
00:42:32,916 --> 00:42:35,063
Why, it's enough like it
to be the same house!

684
00:42:35,173 --> 00:42:37,468
- Really?... Sam, did you hear that?
- Yeah.

685
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:38,924
When will you know?
When will he know?

686
00:42:38,949 --> 00:42:41,210
Well, he's waiting to hear
from South America.

687
00:42:41,438 --> 00:42:43,750
Oh Sam, wouldn't it be wonderful
if we could get it?

688
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,271
I mean, if they didn't ask too much, huh?

689
00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:48,480
Yes, if the price is decent.

690
00:42:48,851 --> 00:42:51,311
What's the matter?
Don't you want to buy a house?

691
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,342
Oh, excuse me, I'll answer that.

692
00:43:04,347 --> 00:43:06,081
- Want some more meat sauce?
- Oh, no. Thank you.

693
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:08,410
Sister dear!

694
00:43:08,798 --> 00:43:12,432
- Yes, brother dear.
- Please pass the soap.

695
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,256
- You have only the two?
- Yes.

696
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,284
Tell me, how many bedrooms
are there in the house?

697
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:26,281
Well, there's three bedrooms and a den
that can be used for a spare.

698
00:43:26,331 --> 00:43:29,876
Oh, that's fine. We can use the extra room
because of the children.

699
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:31,492
Have you any?

700
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:40,911
I'm sorry, but this is very important.

701
00:43:41,407 --> 00:43:44,080
Someone wants to see me,
that owes me some money.

702
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:48,422
They may pay me.
- Oh, no, Sam. Well, by all means, get your things!

703
00:43:48,463 --> 00:43:50,530
- Well, I didn't want to leave you...
- With us?...

704
00:43:50,673 --> 00:43:53,384
- No, I didn't mean...
- Shoot it clean, Sam!

705
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:55,678
Sam, I'll be perfectly alright.

706
00:43:59,254 --> 00:44:02,141
Oh, our dearest friend!
Welcome to our domicile!

707
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,026
And here's little mother,
isn't she beautiful?

708
00:44:04,051 --> 00:44:06,460
- Hello.
- Hello!

709
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:13,371
Oh Sam, we're just bursting with happiness,
thanks to you.

710
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:17,066
Sam, I won't kiss you, but I would like
to extend a right hand loaded with gratitude.

711
00:44:17,577 --> 00:44:18,766
Come on, sit down.

712
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,943
We asked you over here because...

713
00:44:25,123 --> 00:44:28,125
well, we didn't know yet whether you
told Lu anything about our loan.

714
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:31,513
No, it's better this way.
How's business?

715
00:44:31,538 --> 00:44:33,938
Great, great! We got the busiest
little gas station in the county,

716
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:35,333
and things are getting better all the time.

717
00:44:35,384 --> 00:44:37,468
I'm gonna build a little one-room
and bath in the rear of the station,

718
00:44:37,493 --> 00:44:38,633
we're gonna live there too.

719
00:44:38,716 --> 00:44:41,309
You see, that way we'd be...
saving the rent on this thing.

720
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,396
That is, if... you think that's a good idea.

721
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:45,608
I've got all the
materials ordered.

722
00:44:45,807 --> 00:44:48,089
I can cancel it though, if
you don't think it's wise.

723
00:44:48,305 --> 00:44:50,105
No, I- I think it's a good idea.

724
00:44:50,978 --> 00:44:53,597
Oh, when do you think you'll be able
to start paying me back?

725
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:57,180
Well, the way business is going, I think
I can start paying you next month.

726
00:44:57,322 --> 00:44:59,428
We should have it all paid off within six.

727
00:45:00,358 --> 00:45:02,783
Sam, I hope you feel alright
about this thing, because...

728
00:45:02,808 --> 00:45:06,350
well, sometimes we worry because...
you haven't told Lu.

729
00:45:07,179 --> 00:45:11,118
Oh, no, I think it'll be better
to surprise her when you pay me.

730
00:45:11,678 --> 00:45:13,054
Much better.

731
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:23,120
I'd have been home earlier,
only that... the darned car...

732
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:25,805
- What's the matter?
- Stalled three times.

733
00:45:26,245 --> 00:45:27,612
It'll never be the same.

734
00:45:28,283 --> 00:45:31,290
Did anybody pay you, or could you have
stayed here and have a nice dinner?

735
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:34,642
Well, it wasn't wasted time, but...
I'll explain to you later.

736
00:45:34,667 --> 00:45:36,600
- Oh, they didn't pay you.
- No.

737
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:41,893
Well, did you have a barrel of fun
with the Nelsons?

738
00:45:41,918 --> 00:45:42,886
Oh, sure.

739
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,873
When they finally left,
I took a hot bath for my nerves.

740
00:45:45,999 --> 00:45:47,972
And then, what do you think happened?

741
00:45:48,327 --> 00:45:51,664
Before you go any farther,
let me tell you I'm...

742
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,048
I'm sorry for wishing all these people on you.

743
00:45:54,298 --> 00:45:58,045
It isn't fair. I'm through getting you
in all these things.

744
00:45:58,573 --> 00:46:02,301
No more Nelson ruining our dinner,
no more Butlers ruining our car...

745
00:46:02,769 --> 00:46:05,978
Speaking of Butler,
that four-eyed Ford flusher,

746
00:46:06,211 --> 00:46:09,760
now it can be told: he put
a great big dent in our fender!

747
00:46:10,086 --> 00:46:12,607
Which cost me $8.75 more!

748
00:46:12,707 --> 00:46:14,213
- No!
- Yes.

749
00:46:14,574 --> 00:46:18,692
I figured, why ask him for it, when the deadbeat
won't pay me the $19 he owes me now.

750
00:46:19,126 --> 00:46:21,757
- And, I didn't want to tell you about it-
- Well, that's alright, Sam.

751
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:24,930
Well, I thought you might, um... rub it in.

752
00:46:25,316 --> 00:46:26,263
Who, me?!

753
00:46:27,125 --> 00:46:28,036
Oh, no!

754
00:46:28,179 --> 00:46:29,518
No? You wouldn't?

755
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:33,602
- You're not mad at me?
- No.

756
00:46:34,842 --> 00:46:36,938
Lu, you're a darling.

757
00:46:41,906 --> 00:46:43,760
Let's forget about other people tonight.

758
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,972
Alright, if we can.

759
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:50,063
Sure we can.
Let's be selfish, and just, uh...

760
00:46:50,946 --> 00:46:52,702
Just think about ourselves, huh?

761
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:57,295
And the heck with the Nelsons!

762
00:46:58,964 --> 00:47:00,870
And the heck with the Butlers!

763
00:47:03,681 --> 00:47:04,954
Oh, Sam, please!

764
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:09,445
What's the matter? Can't you concentrate
on your husband?

765
00:47:09,524 --> 00:47:11,205
I'm doing my best.

766
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:15,341
Well, does my love border on the ridiculous?

767
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:18,198
Yes. In a way, yes.

768
00:47:20,195 --> 00:47:23,474
You know me, don't you?
Sam? Your husband?

769
00:47:24,018 --> 00:47:27,952
- But Sam, you don't understand.
- I... don't unders-

770
00:47:28,579 --> 00:47:32,105
- You remember the Butlers, don't you?
- Butlers, huh?

771
00:47:45,082 --> 00:47:46,101
Good evening.

772
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:48,608
- Hello.
- Hello.

773
00:47:54,215 --> 00:47:56,488
I suppose you think I'm... quite a flirt.

774
00:47:56,934 --> 00:47:58,391
So I hope I didn't shock you.

775
00:47:58,768 --> 00:48:02,071
No. You don't always keep
your shades down, you know?

776
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,861
So what's so funny, what's the joke?

777
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:09,949
I suppose you're wondering why
we're here at this hour.

778
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:11,150
Yes, I certainly am.

779
00:48:11,175 --> 00:48:13,245
Isn't it something we
can take up tomorrow?

780
00:48:13,494 --> 00:48:14,494
No.

781
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:18,621
Well, you thought it was going
to cost you only $27, didn't you?

782
00:48:18,703 --> 00:48:21,966
I mean, for the Butlers
to have a picnic with your car.

783
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:24,409
Well, you haven't heard the half of it.

784
00:48:24,782 --> 00:48:26,604
They really had a picnic.

785
00:48:26,761 --> 00:48:29,012
They turned the other car over.

786
00:48:30,673 --> 00:48:31,829
The other car?

787
00:48:33,349 --> 00:48:34,396
It was his fault!

788
00:48:35,377 --> 00:48:36,309
That's right!

789
00:48:36,334 --> 00:48:39,660
Mr. Butler was driving on,
minding his own business,

790
00:48:39,685 --> 00:48:41,946
when suddenly, right in front of him...

791
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:44,672
But then it was too late, wasn't it,
Mr. Butler?

792
00:48:44,982 --> 00:48:46,104
Yes, much.

793
00:48:47,548 --> 00:48:48,384
Say, what's the idea?

794
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:50,579
You didn't tell me you had an accident
when you brought the car back.

795
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:51,851
Well, I didn't want to worry you.

796
00:48:51,876 --> 00:48:54,784
I thought I could talk to the fellow,
and that he'd be reasonable, and...

797
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:57,857
I did have a nice talk with him
down in the ravine.

798
00:48:58,634 --> 00:49:00,578
Good. Quiet, Lu.

799
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:02,791
But... when I heard what he wanted,

800
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:05,992
it was just ridiculous,
I knew you'd never pay that.

801
00:49:06,283 --> 00:49:07,343
Me? What about you?

802
00:49:07,374 --> 00:49:08,976
Well, that just what I told him,
I said "Look,"

803
00:49:09,001 --> 00:49:11,173
"If you're going to sue anybody,
sue me."

804
00:49:11,343 --> 00:49:12,963
"Don't sue a nice guy like Sam Clayton,"

805
00:49:12,994 --> 00:49:15,504
"It wasn't his fault."
Except, uh...

806
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,446
Legally, it was your car!

807
00:49:22,762 --> 00:49:26,373
He said he looked me up, and I have a
reputation for not paying my bills.

808
00:49:26,398 --> 00:49:28,183
Just because I haven't been working!

809
00:49:28,611 --> 00:49:30,517
I lost my job, incidentally.

810
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:34,648
See, you tried to do us a favour, and...

811
00:49:34,673 --> 00:49:37,075
he lost his job because of you!

812
00:49:37,151 --> 00:49:40,044
- Well...
- That's how life is.

813
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,641
- If you hadn't loaned us your car...
- Your car!

814
00:49:43,666 --> 00:49:45,609
That's where it all started.

815
00:49:45,686 --> 00:49:47,167
Now, I'll tell you how it happened.

816
00:49:47,171 --> 00:49:50,709
This is fascinating. Oh, pardon me,
go ahead, Mr. Butler.

817
00:49:50,817 --> 00:49:54,494
You don't have to. It will be in the complaint,
all written up, and I can read it.

818
00:49:55,331 --> 00:49:56,356
Good night.

819
00:49:57,163 --> 00:49:58,837
Don't you wanna go too?

820
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,509
Everything happens to us...

821
00:50:02,812 --> 00:50:05,071
Just when we were trying so hard
to save some money too.

822
00:50:05,819 --> 00:50:07,715
I know exactly how you feel.

823
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:09,944
We've been trying to save money
to buy a home,

824
00:50:10,001 --> 00:50:11,638
haven't we, dear?
- We sure have.

825
00:50:11,693 --> 00:50:15,433
It's the same with us. Some day
we hoped to get his eyes fixed.

826
00:50:15,528 --> 00:50:17,487
Never mind about my eyes.

827
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:20,887
That's what they're going to say,
they're gonna try and give me that old eye test.

828
00:50:21,795 --> 00:50:23,370
We'll fight this together!

829
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:26,358
I can see as well as the next fellow.

830
00:50:28,487 --> 00:50:30,256
Oh, thanks.

831
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:33,997
Over there, dear.

832
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:35,042
- Oh...
- Over there.

833
00:50:35,067 --> 00:50:36,914
Where will they put them next?!

834
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,981
What were you thinking of, dear?

835
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:54,096
Do you want to pick me up
and start all over again?

836
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,734
You're darned right I do.

837
00:51:01,993 --> 00:51:05,539
Oh, oh, do you have a first-aid kit?

838
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,857
He hit his head on one of those
potted plants,

839
00:51:07,884 --> 00:51:09,970
you shouldn't have those things
hanging there,

840
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:11,746
this is getting to be, oh...

841
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:42,279
I know you've heard this before,
but I'm sorry again...

842
00:51:46,212 --> 00:51:47,612
Yes, I know, dear.

843
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:50,801
But now we have a lawsuit on our hands.

844
00:51:51,175 --> 00:51:53,161
Our home is farther away than ever.

845
00:51:53,732 --> 00:51:55,386
Damages, attorney’s fees...

846
00:51:55,797 --> 00:51:58,613
If this keeps up, we won't be able
to buy a tent!

847
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:01,514
We just can't go on like this.

848
00:52:02,558 --> 00:52:05,132
Sam... When are you going to learn

849
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:08,552
that there's some people in this world
who don't deserve your help?

850
00:52:09,283 --> 00:52:12,659
Just think of the people you've done things for
since we've been married.

851
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,683
Then think of how many have paid you back.

852
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:17,705
Take Claude, for instance...

853
00:52:17,947 --> 00:52:21,518
he's sleeping in my bed, our bed...
with you!

854
00:52:22,153 --> 00:52:25,143
Butch is in there on the cut,
and I'm here with Lulu.

855
00:52:25,168 --> 00:52:26,563
For how long?...

856
00:52:27,117 --> 00:52:30,397
Sam, we have no life of our own.

857
00:52:30,943 --> 00:52:33,195
This isn't what my mother told me at all.

858
00:52:33,747 --> 00:52:37,701
- Honey, we've tried every other arrangement...
- Except to throw my brother out.

859
00:52:38,345 --> 00:52:43,405
Oh, I know- I know he was badly wounded,
and I tried to make allowances for it,

860
00:52:43,731 --> 00:52:45,829
but, Sam, he's got to move!

861
00:52:46,295 --> 00:52:49,469
- Oh, I think Claude's got a lot of...
- Lead?

862
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:54,334
I can't throw him out until he finds himself.

863
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:56,907
But he's not even looking for himself!

864
00:52:57,603 --> 00:53:00,107
Oh, I know it's ungrateful to say that

865
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:02,386
about a man who's done so much
for his country,

866
00:53:02,819 --> 00:53:06,193
but... if- if he'd just go away somewhere.

867
00:53:07,422 --> 00:53:11,834
Maybe he could find himself in South Africa.
A lot of people find themselves there!

868
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:15,785
I know- I know how you feel.
I'm not too happy in there myself.

869
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:20,021
Us... we three boys.

870
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:24,567
Who could that be at this hour?

871
00:53:26,131 --> 00:53:27,391
I'll find out.

872
00:53:28,364 --> 00:53:31,143
Whoever it is there, be firm.
Not another nickel!

873
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:32,205
Not another nickel! Shhh...

874
00:53:32,687 --> 00:53:35,022
And if they refuse the charges, hang up!

875
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,582
Your brother is not coming home tonight.

876
00:54:06,158 --> 00:54:07,619
Can we depend on that?

877
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:11,758
Yes... He's going to Cincinnati.

878
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:13,189
No!

879
00:54:13,243 --> 00:54:14,859
Yes, for ten days!

880
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,680
Goodie! Maybe he'll
find himself there.

881
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:19,668
- Yeah.
- What's he going to do?

882
00:54:19,737 --> 00:54:23,379
There's a big music festival.
Everybody's coming from miles around.

883
00:54:23,404 --> 00:54:25,945
Not my brother.
What's he going to do?

884
00:54:26,704 --> 00:54:28,828
- Shoot pool.
- That's more like him.

885
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:30,788
There's a big tournament, he's pretty good,
you know.

886
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:36,151
So I hear. I think pool's very nice.
Don't you?

887
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:39,270
Yeah, pool's a very interesting game,

888
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:40,984
a very old game,

889
00:54:42,361 --> 00:54:46,210
and I think it's very nice of Claude to call
and let us know, don't you think?

890
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:49,618
Daddy! Mommy!

891
00:55:04,709 --> 00:55:07,519
Daddy, now you have to tell me a story!

892
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:10,152
Alright. Which story do you want?

893
00:55:10,204 --> 00:55:11,269
Cinderella!

894
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:13,228
First we've got to get in the bed.

895
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,360
Now, we keep her up.
There!

896
00:55:19,017 --> 00:55:22,953
Now, once upon a time there was
a little girl named Cinderella.

897
00:55:23,829 --> 00:55:26,190
And... she had two wicked sisters.

898
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,049
And didn't she have a wicked aunt too?

899
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:33,005
Oh, yeah, she used to make Cinderella
work from morning until dark.

900
00:55:33,112 --> 00:55:36,446
Well, anyway, along came
a fairy godmother,

901
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,270
and changed little Cinderella into a
beautiful princess.

902
00:55:40,347 --> 00:55:42,265
What about the mice, Daddy?

903
00:55:42,483 --> 00:55:43,347
What mice?

904
00:55:44,804 --> 00:55:47,558
The fairy godmother had some mice.

905
00:55:47,621 --> 00:55:49,038
Oh, she did? Oh, yeah.

906
00:55:49,195 --> 00:55:53,863
And she, uh... And she turned the mice
into six beautiful white horses.

907
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:55,011
That's right!

908
00:55:55,036 --> 00:55:58,137
So Cinderella went out to the garden and
brought a great big pumpkin, and...

909
00:55:58,473 --> 00:56:00,601
and, uh... gave to the horses.

910
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:02,217
- No!
- No?

911
00:56:02,242 --> 00:56:06,315
And she gave it to the... fairy godmother.

912
00:56:06,617 --> 00:56:12,265
And the fairy skinned it, and turned it
into a six... I mean, a carriage.

913
00:56:12,548 --> 00:56:14,308
That's right, I remember now!

914
00:56:14,495 --> 00:56:18,047
And she hooked up the six white horses
to the pumpkin, I mean, the carriage,

915
00:56:18,437 --> 00:56:23,681
and told Cinderella to jump in the carriage,
and... away they went. Hmm?

916
00:56:24,438 --> 00:56:26,494
And they went away- They went to the ball.

917
00:56:26,632 --> 00:56:29,020
Yeah. They went to the ball.
Now, Cinderella...

918
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:31,700
... was all- She was changed into a
beautiful princess by this time, wasn't she?

919
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:37,028
- Yeah.
- And... oh! Boy, what a princess!

920
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:43,097
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

921
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:47,600
Oh, well, uh...
Beautiful princess!

922
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:51,943
Oh, she was so beautiful, she...

923
00:56:52,418 --> 00:56:53,782
Oh, gosh.

924
00:56:57,436 --> 00:57:02,303
What a beautiful princess!
Oh, yeah, and she lost her shoe...

925
00:57:02,706 --> 00:57:04,953
And she had so many children,
she didn't know what to do.

926
00:57:04,978 --> 00:57:07,346
Oh, Daddy, that's another story!

927
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:09,321
And they were all hungry besides.

928
00:57:09,673 --> 00:57:12,045
So she went to the cupboard,
and the cupboard was bare...

929
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,046
So the poor bear had none.

930
00:57:16,514 --> 00:57:18,911
Well, anyway, where was I?

931
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:23,381
Let me tell you a story, Daddy,
and you go to sleep!

932
00:57:23,545 --> 00:57:24,481
Alright.

933
00:57:29,461 --> 00:57:34,453
So Cinderella waited and waited...
for days and days...

934
00:57:35,469 --> 00:57:39,115
The question was, would she
and Prince Charming...

935
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:44,010
... ever... get together?

936
00:57:47,324 --> 00:57:50,737
... when suddenly, the door opened,

937
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:54,970
and there he stood, the prince himself!

938
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:05,091
So everybody in the fairyland
went to sleep.

939
00:58:07,195 --> 00:58:09,075
Three little pigs went to sleep,

940
00:58:10,057 --> 00:58:12,180
the big bad wolf went to sleep...

941
00:58:13,710 --> 00:58:18,995
Little Miss Muffet was so tired,
she collapsed and fell on a tuffet.

942
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,642
and the spider went to sleep beside her.

943
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:26,507
Everybody was so tired!

944
00:58:27,735 --> 00:58:31,143
Even the Sandman had stopped counting
the sheep in the meadow...

945
00:58:31,312 --> 00:58:33,112
the cows in the corn...

946
00:58:35,626 --> 00:58:37,616
Everybody's asleep but us...

947
00:58:39,030 --> 00:58:40,697
Just you and me.

948
00:58:48,888 --> 00:58:50,262
What's the matter?

949
00:58:51,788 --> 00:58:53,100
No!...

950
00:58:56,277 --> 00:58:57,451
Boo!

951
00:59:08,979 --> 00:59:10,509
Well... What happened?

952
00:59:10,633 --> 00:59:14,206
I've got a surprise for you!
I've given up pool.

953
00:59:14,646 --> 00:59:16,751
- He's given up-
- Yes, I heard.

954
00:59:16,776 --> 00:59:19,771
You hung up so fast, I thought
you were disgusted with me!

955
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:21,562
Oh, no, it- what...

956
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:27,470
Say, what's the occasion?
What are you two all dolled up for?

957
00:59:27,589 --> 00:59:30,016
Oh, this is just...
What was it?

958
00:59:30,426 --> 00:59:33,495
We were just celebrating
the longest day of the year.

959
00:59:33,581 --> 00:59:34,828
Yes, that is.

960
00:59:34,909 --> 00:59:36,208
Oh... I don't get it!

961
00:59:36,347 --> 00:59:37,848
Mommy!

962
00:59:38,876 --> 00:59:40,266
You explain it to him.

963
00:59:40,291 --> 00:59:42,255
I'll tell Lulu another story.

964
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:44,731
Forever, uh... Goldilocks.

965
00:59:50,359 --> 00:59:51,801
I'll get it, Sam.

966
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:58,684
Is this Samuel R. Clayton's house?

967
00:59:58,709 --> 01:00:00,950
- Yeah, uh-huh.
- I'm Sam Clayton.

968
01:00:01,059 --> 01:00:02,846
Mm... yeah...

969
01:00:04,499 --> 01:00:07,545
Look, I got a girl in the back of my car,
and she's in bad way.

970
01:00:08,262 --> 01:00:09,958
She had me stop at the drugstore
for a minute,

971
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:12,115
I should got wise then,
but I didn't.

972
01:00:12,411 --> 01:00:15,141
Next thing I know, I look in the mirror,
I don't see her.

973
01:00:15,639 --> 01:00:17,790
I turns around and there she is,
out on the floor.

974
01:00:18,422 --> 01:00:20,555
Uh... but look, this is a private residence.

975
01:00:20,580 --> 01:00:22,092
Why don't you take her to a receiving hosp-

976
01:00:22,117 --> 01:00:22,912
Yeah, I know...

977
01:00:22,937 --> 01:00:25,657
Look, buddy, I wouldn't act so wise
if I was in your shoes, you know.

978
01:00:25,682 --> 01:00:27,702
I might be doing you a favour!

979
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:30,217
I just didn't find the sleeping pills,

980
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:33,515
I found your card, Samuel R. Clayton!

981
01:00:34,472 --> 01:00:36,315
Oh, I know who it is. Shirley May!

982
01:00:37,725 --> 01:00:39,520
Shirley May. He knows her!

983
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:51,724
Sam, you gotta keep a level head,
Lu is right in there!

984
01:00:51,763 --> 01:00:54,929
Oh, be quiet. Go call Dr. Brown,
Orange 3621.

985
01:00:57,831 --> 01:00:59,043
All right, Sam.

986
01:01:26,087 --> 01:01:28,059
It's alright, Lu, she works at the store.

987
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:32,939
She took an overdose of sleeping pills.

988
01:01:32,964 --> 01:01:35,432
Is there something we can do
before the doctor gets here?

989
01:01:37,052 --> 01:01:38,452
What happened, Mommy?

990
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:41,682
I don't know yet, dear.
You go get mommy's bed.

991
01:01:43,527 --> 01:01:46,042
Uh... Lu, don't you think
you oughta get something on?

992
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:57,039
What is it,  Lu, what's so serious?

993
01:01:57,936 --> 01:01:58,967
What is it?

994
01:02:08,464 --> 01:02:09,963
He doesn't drink?

995
01:02:11,112 --> 01:02:13,582
No, sometimes I wish he did.

996
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:15,931
Gamble?

997
01:02:16,102 --> 01:02:19,255
No, but I'd prefer it to what he's doing.

998
01:02:20,072 --> 01:02:21,723
He isn't in love with somebody else?

999
01:02:22,487 --> 01:02:23,364
Yes.

1000
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:28,093
Everybody!
He loves everybody!

1001
01:02:29,001 --> 01:02:31,235
He's in love with the human race, and...

1002
01:02:31,296 --> 01:02:33,794
animals, and birdlife and fish!

1003
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:36,931
Why, he wouldn't even swat a fly!

1004
01:02:37,133 --> 01:02:40,210
Or any of those leeches who cling to him.

1005
01:02:40,889 --> 01:02:43,321
He just can't help helping people!

1006
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,253
And that's bad?

1007
01:02:45,631 --> 01:02:47,916
Well... how does that affect your life?

1008
01:02:48,248 --> 01:02:49,353
What life?

1009
01:02:51,953 --> 01:02:53,407
Oh... all right...

1010
01:02:54,009 --> 01:02:57,004
You say marriage is a case
of give and take...

1011
01:02:57,633 --> 01:03:01,882
Well... he gives everything away,
and just have to take it.

1012
01:03:03,218 --> 01:03:05,717
He is so sorry for people...

1013
01:03:06,767 --> 01:03:10,234
He is his brother's keeper,
and he's got too many brothers.

1014
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:14,010
He started with my brother,
and he's built up from there.

1015
01:03:14,998 --> 01:03:17,445
He wants a house by the side of the road,

1016
01:03:17,905 --> 01:03:19,650
"and to be a friend to man."

1017
01:03:21,178 --> 01:03:22,850
And I do the cooking!

1018
01:03:25,054 --> 01:03:29,549
Oh, don't look at me like that.
I know I sound like an idiot!

1019
01:03:31,481 --> 01:03:33,198
I know how I feel, but ...

1020
01:03:33,612 --> 01:03:36,335
when I say it, it just doesn't
come out right.

1021
01:03:38,612 --> 01:03:40,128
It sounds selfish,

1022
01:03:40,802 --> 01:03:45,066
but... there are other words,
like... wanting and wishing and...

1023
01:03:45,453 --> 01:03:47,559
yearning... and needing!

1024
01:03:48,163 --> 01:03:51,119
Lu... let's get one thing straight.

1025
01:03:51,887 --> 01:03:56,828
All peoples are agreed that there's
nothing greater than helping one another,

1026
01:03:56,853 --> 01:04:00,057
it's... the only way we can make
a happier world.

1027
01:04:00,205 --> 01:04:01,960
But- but you... you have a point.

1028
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:05,447
Here I've been
selling this all my life,

1029
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:08,195
and a man takes me up on it,
now his home's unhappy.

1030
01:04:08,718 --> 01:04:12,699
Well, there's no question but what the...
happiness of the home comes first.

1031
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:15,855
Sam's a good father.

1032
01:04:16,384 --> 01:04:19,321
Do the... children suffer by his actions?

1033
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:22,334
Oh, no, no.
He's a good father all right!

1034
01:04:23,874 --> 01:04:25,142
He's a good husband?

1035
01:04:26,277 --> 01:04:30,849
Well, he's got a blonde from the store in our
bed right now , if that's what you mean.

1036
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:33,551
Oh no, no, it's perfectly harmless!

1037
01:04:33,832 --> 01:04:37,992
She just tried to commit suicide,
so he brought her in.

1038
01:04:38,906 --> 01:04:42,568
Well... maybe Sam's overdoing it a little.

1039
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:48,675
I hope my sermon last Sunday
didn't cause him to go overboard?

1040
01:04:49,072 --> 01:04:52,734
Oh, no. No, that didn't start it.

1041
01:04:53,975 --> 01:04:56,204
It might have aggravated it a little...

1042
01:04:56,908 --> 01:04:58,776
but he's always been like that!

1043
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:01,864
Even on our honeymoon.

1044
01:05:02,116 --> 01:05:05,030
He saw a man with his car stuck
in the mud,

1045
01:05:05,203 --> 01:05:06,485
wheels spinning.

1046
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:09,582
My Sam jumps out, gathers twigs,

1047
01:05:09,607 --> 01:05:13,099
rips branches off trees and
shoves them under the wheels.

1048
01:05:13,982 --> 01:05:17,518
Then, for chains, he takes
the straps off our suitcases,

1049
01:05:17,666 --> 01:05:19,820
and wraps them around the tires.

1050
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:24,814
Then, on his hands and knees,
covered with mud,

1051
01:05:25,068 --> 01:05:26,856
he says, "Now try it."

1052
01:05:27,811 --> 01:05:30,987
So the man put the car in reverse
and ran over him.

1053
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:34,438
Then without even a word
of thanks or apology,

1054
01:05:34,650 --> 01:05:37,840
the man drove away!
With our straps!

1055
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:44,030
Sam spent most of our honeymoon
in the Queen of the Angels Hospital.

1056
01:05:45,197 --> 01:05:47,689
That's when I learned to play the saxophone!

1057
01:05:52,943 --> 01:05:57,244
Now, you'd think that would be a lesson
to him about helping his fellow man.

1058
01:05:57,544 --> 01:05:58,509
But no!

1059
01:05:58,745 --> 01:06:01,336
Lu, you still love the big guy.
Give him another chance.

1060
01:06:01,429 --> 01:06:02,549
I'll talk to him.

1061
01:06:04,492 --> 01:06:05,292
Well...

1062
01:06:05,317 --> 01:06:07,978
I don't know exactly how to
put it to him,

1063
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:12,371
I don't want to tell him to disregard
everything that I stand for, I...

1064
01:06:13,961 --> 01:06:17,885
I- I'm not sure just yet
how I'll tell him, but, uh...

1065
01:06:19,288 --> 01:06:21,508
I'll look up something on moderation.

1066
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:25,695
Well, that... that might help.

1067
01:06:26,408 --> 01:06:27,568
What's the best way to see him,

1068
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:30,506
how can I meet him "accidentally", huh?

1069
01:06:31,402 --> 01:06:35,502
Well, you could run into him casually
at the Athletic Club.

1070
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,021
He takes a workout on his lunch hour.

1071
01:06:38,414 --> 01:06:40,823
If he hasn't given his trunks away!

1072
01:06:51,187 --> 01:06:52,915
We're having lamb chops for dinner.

1073
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:54,375
What did you have for lunch?

1074
01:06:54,449 --> 01:06:57,786
Oh, salad! They make
a marvelous salad at the club.

1075
01:06:58,128 --> 01:06:59,892
And a glass of tomato juice.

1076
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:02,550
Did you, uh... eat alone?

1077
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:04,742
No, with Reverend Daniels.

1078
01:07:05,379 --> 01:07:07,445
I asked him what he was doing at the club,
and he said,

1079
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:09,166
"A little exercise wouldn't hurt anybody."

1080
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:12,626
He did. You know, there's a man
with a brilliant mind.

1081
01:07:13,101 --> 01:07:15,280
People just don't appreciate his wisdom.

1082
01:07:15,582 --> 01:07:18,077
More people should listen to
his sound advice.

1083
01:07:19,042 --> 01:07:22,168
Well, if you ask me,
I think he's a little mixed up.

1084
01:07:23,323 --> 01:07:25,608
I think he's having trouble
with his wife.

1085
01:07:25,965 --> 01:07:28,417
He is-... He is?

1086
01:07:30,162 --> 01:07:32,896
It's got so upset, I think
it's affecting his health.

1087
01:07:33,276 --> 01:07:35,150
So the poor man is gonna start
going to the club,

1088
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:37,592
and exercise, and try to
get back into shape.

1089
01:07:37,902 --> 01:07:41,092
Oh... What did he say to you?

1090
01:07:41,901 --> 01:07:45,117
Well, he didn't say much of anything.
I did most of the talking.

1091
01:07:45,986 --> 01:07:50,029
He seemed so... troubled and...
unable to express himself.

1092
01:07:50,986 --> 01:07:52,160
I think it's serious, Lu.

1093
01:07:52,185 --> 01:07:55,260
You should have seen the look on his face
when I suggested that, uh...

1094
01:07:55,544 --> 01:07:58,258
that maybe you should go over
and have a little talk with his wife,

1095
01:07:58,283 --> 01:07:59,875
and try to straighten her out.

1096
01:08:00,288 --> 01:08:01,269
Yeah...

1097
01:08:02,614 --> 01:08:04,341
I said to him that...

1098
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:08,419
you'd gone through a few things
with... with me, in a small way...

1099
01:08:08,687 --> 01:08:09,990
but you are so level-headed!

1100
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:13,410
I knew something was wrong
when he said:

1101
01:08:13,810 --> 01:08:16,790
"Our wives' happiness is the only
important consideration."

1102
01:08:17,623 --> 01:08:21,803
He said, "We must give up whatever
is necessary to achieve that."

1103
01:08:22,270 --> 01:08:24,122
And you had an answer for that?

1104
01:08:25,493 --> 01:08:28,254
No. I asked him a question.

1105
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:31,943
How much does a wife expect a man
to give up?

1106
01:08:32,827 --> 01:08:35,623
Should he ask her every time
before he makes a decision?

1107
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:38,105
How much of his own judgement
should he rely on?

1108
01:08:38,438 --> 01:08:40,097
And how often should he run to her?

1109
01:08:41,070 --> 01:08:42,803
If he ran to her all the time, she wouldn't want him,

1110
01:08:42,828 --> 01:08:44,662
 because he had no judgement.

1111
01:08:45,297 --> 01:08:48,345
I mean, if he's going to drop a dime
into a beggar's hat,

1112
01:08:48,495 --> 01:08:50,210
does he have to run to the telephone first,

1113
01:08:50,235 --> 01:08:52,268
and spend a nickel of it
to ask her permission?

1114
01:08:52,418 --> 01:08:54,885
That's silly.
- I should say.

1115
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:57,425
My point is,

1116
01:08:57,715 --> 01:08:59,699
if he's gonna keep giving things up,

1117
01:09:00,054 --> 01:09:02,758
why doesn't he give up his self-respect,
and just give up?

1118
01:09:03,645 --> 01:09:05,557
She knew what he was
before she married him.

1119
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:08,114
She knew what she was getting into,
didn't she?

1120
01:09:09,425 --> 01:09:10,966
Poor Mrs. Daniels.

1121
01:09:26,602 --> 01:09:28,711
My new home.
We'll take it!

1122
01:09:28,810 --> 01:09:30,550
Wait till you see the inside.

1123
01:09:31,117 --> 01:09:32,631
Come on, Sam.

1124
01:09:36,627 --> 01:09:38,409
Isn't this beautiful?

1125
01:09:39,315 --> 01:09:41,146
And look at that view!

1126
01:09:42,707 --> 01:09:43,724
Sam ...

1127
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:48,340
ask Mrs. Nelson how much it is.
And don't quibble!

1128
01:09:50,701 --> 01:09:52,724
You won't have any trouble with him.

1129
01:10:04,277 --> 01:10:05,686
It's not bad, you know...

1130
01:10:06,542 --> 01:10:09,431
Another fireplace! And it's real!

1131
01:10:10,675 --> 01:10:12,868
Hey, you're making it
awfully tough for me!

1132
01:10:20,285 --> 01:10:24,122
Oh, I've never seen anything
like it. Have you?

1133
01:10:24,288 --> 01:10:25,248
Agree.

1134
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:32,835
And we won't even have
to change the wallpaper!

1135
01:10:35,330 --> 01:10:36,243
What's the matter?

1136
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:38,102
Bed too small for you?

1137
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:45,627
- Little short, huh?
- Little.

1138
01:10:45,937 --> 01:10:47,180
We'll put a leaf in.

1139
01:10:49,995 --> 01:10:52,832
Oh, Sam... look behind you.

1140
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:05,814
This is paradise!

1141
01:11:12,593 --> 01:11:16,686
When I think of my dressing table,
I can't bear to look at myself in this thing.

1142
01:11:17,671 --> 01:11:19,997
Sam, what's holding us up?

1143
01:11:20,858 --> 01:11:23,214
Why didn't you close the deal on the spot?

1144
01:11:24,164 --> 01:11:26,867
- Oh, you just can't do things that way.
- You can't?

1145
01:11:27,422 --> 01:11:28,918
Well, she promised to hold it.

1146
01:11:29,007 --> 01:11:31,644
Well, I hate to think of waiting
even 24 hours!

1147
01:11:32,034 --> 01:11:33,385
What are we waiting for?

1148
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:35,705
We've got over 5,000 in the house fund.

1149
01:11:36,433 --> 01:11:39,351
Sam, we'll never find a place
more beautiful!

1150
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:41,958
And I promise you, I'll cut expenses.

1151
01:11:41,983 --> 01:11:43,658
In every conceivable way.

1152
01:11:43,984 --> 01:11:46,504
And don't give me a Christmas present,
not a thing!

1153
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,071
This is the greatest present
you could ever give me!

1154
01:11:49,282 --> 01:11:51,462
This is the present of my life!

1155
01:11:52,624 --> 01:11:54,849
Guess who was here and left a note for you.

1156
01:11:55,101 --> 01:11:56,476
Mr. and Mrs. Adams,

1157
01:11:56,501 --> 01:11:59,075
that lovely little couple
used to live next door.

1158
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:00,637
I miss her.

1159
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:02,574
How time flies!

1160
01:12:02,664 --> 01:12:04,563
You know, they've been gone
about eight months now,

1161
01:12:04,588 --> 01:12:05,965
and she's big as I am!

1162
01:12:06,168 --> 01:12:08,879
If it's a boy, they gonna call it Samuel.

1163
01:12:09,165 --> 01:12:11,462
And if it's a girl, Lucile.

1164
01:12:11,536 --> 01:12:14,595
They couldn't wait, that's the reason
why they left you that note.

1165
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,277
- Thank you, Chloe.
- You're welcome.

1166
01:12:17,510 --> 01:12:20,105
Is it confidential, Sam,
or is it money?

1167
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,147
Thirty-nine dollars and fifty cents.

1168
01:12:27,138 --> 01:12:29,131
What are they sending you money for?

1169
01:12:30,174 --> 01:12:31,301
Well...

1170
01:12:32,753 --> 01:12:34,687
Last summer, when you were away,

1171
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:37,373
I spent some time with them
and they had a problem.

1172
01:12:37,425 --> 01:12:39,682
Oh, and what did good Sam do?

1173
01:12:40,185 --> 01:12:42,856
He said, "Look no further.
I sold everything."

1174
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:44,674
"Here's your 39.50"

1175
01:12:45,145 --> 01:12:48,885
Alright. So you loaned them money
and they paid you back. That's nice!

1176
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:50,475
Lu...

1177
01:12:50,676 --> 01:12:54,795
They were worried about
whether or not to have the baby.

1178
01:12:56,124 --> 01:12:58,189
Which, they are now going to have!

1179
01:12:59,634 --> 01:13:02,896
Well, things were bad for him,
no money and no work.

1180
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:07,282
And they had a chance to
grab a spot on Highway 72 ...

1181
01:13:07,307 --> 01:13:08,882
where a lot of trucks go by.

1182
01:13:09,316 --> 01:13:11,165
It's a wonderful intersection, Lu,

1183
01:13:11,245 --> 01:13:12,835
and they're doing very well.

1184
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:17,222
On 39.50? What have they got,
a portable peanuts stand?

1185
01:13:19,406 --> 01:13:21,462
Oh, no, a gas station.

1186
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:27,026
There's a lot of money in it, of course
it takes time to get established...

1187
01:13:29,941 --> 01:13:32,038
How much did you give them?

1188
01:13:33,026 --> 01:13:36,728
It's a triple intersection, Lu.
You see, 72 and another one here ...

1189
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:38,237
Sam, please.

1190
01:13:38,689 --> 01:13:41,233
Oh, don't worry.
They'll pay us back.

1191
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:45,128
You can't guess how many trucks go by.

1192
01:13:45,565 --> 01:13:46,985
We sat there and clocked them,

1193
01:13:47,010 --> 01:13:49,198
and you'd be surprised.
How many do you think?

1194
01:13:49,913 --> 01:13:51,795
How much did you give them?

1195
01:13:53,774 --> 01:13:56,575
Oh... Well, they'd have paid us back sooner, only...

1196
01:13:56,861 --> 01:14:00,086
behind the gas station they built
a little, tiny...

1197
01:14:01,988 --> 01:14:02,997
A home?

1198
01:14:05,255 --> 01:14:07,368
Yeah, but... it's nothing you'd like...

1199
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:12,393
Sam, you've given away
the whole house fund.

1200
01:14:12,872 --> 01:14:16,661
- Lu, these people are really worthwhile, dependable...
- Oh, Sam!

1201
01:14:18,928 --> 01:14:21,593
Oh, uh... let me- let me explain it, honey.

1202
01:14:23,645 --> 01:14:29,058
Darling... You do believe babies
should be born, don't you?

1203
01:14:29,223 --> 01:14:31,625
Don't throw their baby in my face!

1204
01:14:31,980 --> 01:14:35,841
No wonder you wanted 24 hours.
What good'll that do?

1205
01:14:35,959 --> 01:14:38,388
It's more like 24 years!

1206
01:14:39,448 --> 01:14:43,284
What's the baby do,
sell papers and pay us back?

1207
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:45,054
Oh, Sam!

1208
01:14:46,745 --> 01:14:50,755
Why can't people stand on their own
two feet and have babies?

1209
01:14:53,701 --> 01:14:56,865
Well, I- I know it seems wrong not to have
discussed with you first, but...

1210
01:14:56,954 --> 01:15:00,416
this was an emergency, and you were
down in the country with your mother ...

1211
01:15:00,442 --> 01:15:02,245
Before telephones, Sam?

1212
01:15:03,425 --> 01:15:05,358
The bank wouldn't give it to them because...

1213
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:09,717
well, they had no credit, and...
well, I thought they'd pay me back...

1214
01:15:10,371 --> 01:15:13,212
before, only...
- Before I found out.

1215
01:15:13,484 --> 01:15:16,718
I'm fed up with your helping
people behind my back!

1216
01:15:17,252 --> 01:15:21,931
You are nothing but a double-crossing,
two-faced, sneaking Samaritan!

1217
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:23,409
Lu...

1218
01:15:24,591 --> 01:15:26,658
They're good people.
And they were desperate.

1219
01:15:26,683 --> 01:15:30,371
Oh, shut up!
Go away and leave me alone!

1220
01:15:33,118 --> 01:15:35,289
Well, you'll feel different
after she had the baby.

1221
01:15:35,314 --> 01:15:36,859
So will she!

1222
01:15:59,124 --> 01:16:01,630
Well... this is a pleasant surprise.

1223
01:16:02,407 --> 01:16:04,135
I thought I'd drop by, and see

1224
01:16:04,160 --> 01:16:07,354
how the Claytons were getting along
this fine Sunday afternoon.

1225
01:16:12,864 --> 01:16:14,120
Well, come in.

1226
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:20,990
Well, I watched you two out of
the corner of my eye this morning,

1227
01:16:21,646 --> 01:16:24,962
and was delighted to see you both
looking so serenely happy.

1228
01:16:25,084 --> 01:16:26,582
Yeah, we're happy.

1229
01:16:27,940 --> 01:16:31,852
Hey, how are you and your wife
getting along now? Any better?

1230
01:16:32,311 --> 01:16:36,664
Yes. I don't think we'll have
any more trouble.

1231
01:16:37,342 --> 01:16:39,062
I told her about our little talk, Sam.

1232
01:16:39,087 --> 01:16:40,978
Did a lot of good.
She saw your point.

1233
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:43,995
I told her what you said about
dropping a dime in a beggar's hat,

1234
01:16:44,326 --> 01:16:45,390
made her laugh.

1235
01:16:46,578 --> 01:16:47,618
Well, that's fine.

1236
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,898
There'll be no need for Lu
straightening her out now.

1237
01:16:51,393 --> 01:16:54,863
No, no, I... don't think
that'll be necessary.

1238
01:16:55,218 --> 01:16:59,666
We both arrived to the realization that
so many domestic squabbles are silly.

1239
01:16:59,979 --> 01:17:04,233
Each has to give a little,
and see the other's viewpoint.

1240
01:17:04,671 --> 01:17:08,906
A... simple discussion of the problem,
and it blows away like, uh...

1241
01:17:09,133 --> 01:17:10,472
Boulder Dam, huh?

1242
01:17:12,795 --> 01:17:14,189
Reverend Daniels.

1243
01:17:15,524 --> 01:17:17,538
Do you believe in women having babies?

1244
01:17:19,985 --> 01:17:22,022
Well, I don't know who else, uh...

1245
01:17:22,611 --> 01:17:24,904
Well, under the right circumstances, yes.

1246
01:17:24,929 --> 01:17:26,305
Well, that's what I thought.

1247
01:17:26,924 --> 01:17:29,131
So I the couple next door some money.

1248
01:17:29,161 --> 01:17:31,211
You, soft-hearted, sad...

1249
01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:36,980
You- you, public benefactor, you at-

1250
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:42,041
Hello, Reverend Daniels.

1251
01:17:44,181 --> 01:17:48,351
- Hello.
- It's always a pleasure to see you.

1252
01:17:51,684 --> 01:17:56,940
Well, I just stopped by,
on behalf of a very worthy cause.

1253
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:00,140
It's... something that Sam and I, uh...

1254
01:18:00,995 --> 01:18:03,701
and he thought that you
would be interested too.

1255
01:18:04,278 --> 01:18:07,058
It's, uh... uh... uh...

1256
01:18:08,577 --> 01:18:11,668
What, something that slips
your mind at the moment?

1257
01:18:12,562 --> 01:18:14,555
Bundles for midgets, maybe?

1258
01:18:16,441 --> 01:18:18,330
No!... No...

1259
01:18:18,434 --> 01:18:21,539
It's, uh... a charity bazaar.

1260
01:18:21,815 --> 01:18:26,051
And Sam has volunteered your services
as a gypsy fortune teller.

1261
01:18:27,517 --> 01:18:29,817
He- He is going to be a sideshow barker.

1262
01:18:33,227 --> 01:18:35,837
Oughta raise a lot of money telling fortunes.

1263
01:18:36,992 --> 01:18:39,923
Show her the pretty costume
that you got for her, Sam.

1264
01:18:44,775 --> 01:18:46,645
- No, you show her.
- Oh, no, go ahead!

1265
01:18:46,707 --> 01:18:48,221
- No, here!
- Me?

1266
01:18:49,613 --> 01:18:53,219
Well, it's really... a very nice costume.

1267
01:18:58,608 --> 01:19:00,124
There.

1268
01:19:00,268 --> 01:19:02,447
Now, isn't that a pretty costume?

1269
01:19:03,950 --> 01:19:06,003
You'll be perfect as a gypsy!

1270
01:19:06,448 --> 01:19:07,135
Yeah.

1271
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:09,412
Gypsies have no home, have they?

1272
01:19:15,972 --> 01:19:16,838
Good night, Chloe.

1273
01:19:16,863 --> 01:19:19,851
- And after this you, kids, get home earlier.
- We will.

1274
01:19:22,249 --> 01:19:24,053
- Good night, Chloe.
- See you tomorrow!

1275
01:19:25,063 --> 01:19:26,268
Hey, before we go in,

1276
01:19:26,483 --> 01:19:29,005
would you like fifteen minutes more
of what I think of you?

1277
01:19:29,201 --> 01:19:31,121
Well, I'd like it, Claude,
but it's awfully late.

1278
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:35,007
Look, it's only six o'clock in Australia.
Come on, sit down, please.

1279
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:36,492
Alright.

1280
01:19:38,097 --> 01:19:40,426
You ought to make the most of these moments,
when you're with me.

1281
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,144
No, we better not, Claude.

1282
01:19:43,352 --> 01:19:44,710
Your sister won't like it.

1283
01:19:44,917 --> 01:19:46,354
Never mind my sister!

1284
01:19:46,773 --> 01:19:48,378
And what did I leave off?

1285
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:51,658
Your hair, your eyes, your lips...

1286
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,650
And that sunny smile!
- Oh, stop!

1287
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,800
Did I say I'd walk a million miles
for one of those smiles?

1288
01:19:58,385 --> 01:19:59,950
Did I say I'd climb the highest mountain?

1289
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:01,617
Swim some place too.

1290
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:04,240
And I got you under my skin?

1291
01:20:05,859 --> 01:20:07,033
And, uh...

1292
01:20:08,496 --> 01:20:09,698
Are you impressed?

1293
01:20:10,494 --> 01:20:12,388
I like you very much, Claude, but...

1294
01:20:12,777 --> 01:20:16,115
The Claytons have been wonderful to me,
and I don't think they'd approve of this.

1295
01:20:17,016 --> 01:20:18,891
You see, you don't really know me
very well.

1296
01:20:18,973 --> 01:20:21,165
Well, I'm trying to find out,
the best I can!

1297
01:20:23,591 --> 01:20:24,523
Who is that?

1298
01:20:25,073 --> 01:20:26,389
Uh-oh, we're trapped.

1299
01:20:26,713 --> 01:20:27,802
Don't make a move.

1300
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:32,871
Fixing some coffee, hmm?

1301
01:20:32,922 --> 01:20:34,435
I thought it'd be a good idea.

1302
01:20:34,606 --> 01:20:36,409
I think we'll be up a little late tonight.

1303
01:20:38,528 --> 01:20:40,318
You didn't say a word on the way home.

1304
01:20:40,535 --> 01:20:43,824
I thought you were having a good time,
you danced a lot with H.C.

1305
01:20:44,314 --> 01:20:45,739
You're doing alright, too.

1306
01:20:46,645 --> 01:20:50,568
Sam, H.C.'s offered me my old job back.

1307
01:20:50,729 --> 01:20:53,203
He wants me to go to Europe in the spring
on a buying trip.

1308
01:20:53,333 --> 01:20:55,069
That is, of course, with your approval.

1309
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,222
It is a golden opportunity to put
some money away and...

1310
01:20:58,530 --> 01:21:00,182
I'll only be gone three or four months.

1311
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,876
You can forget it!

1312
01:21:02,705 --> 01:21:05,152
- So that's your attitude!
- You're darn right it is!

1313
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:10,083
Well, I don't understand why you mind,
you hardly ever see me anyway.

1314
01:21:10,668 --> 01:21:12,707
If I go, you can do as you please.

1315
01:21:12,943 --> 01:21:14,465
Maybe I'm holding you back.

1316
01:21:14,552 --> 01:21:17,245
Think of how many more
organizations you could join.

1317
01:21:18,310 --> 01:21:21,473
If I take this job, I get a
complete wardrobe furnished.

1318
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,805
Unlimited expense account,
and a fine salary.

1319
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:26,192
I'm going to Europe!

1320
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:32,181
Well, I don't blame you for feeling that way,
I don't want you working!

1321
01:21:32,343 --> 01:21:34,131
- Oh, you don't, huh?
- No.

1322
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:37,657
I suppose it's alright to go ahead with
the salary you earn and give away, but...

1323
01:21:37,787 --> 01:21:39,297
Sam, if we're ever going to have a home...

1324
01:21:39,322 --> 01:21:40,782
I know how much the house
meant to you.

1325
01:21:40,807 --> 01:21:43,338
Oh, it's not just the house,
it's everything!

1326
01:21:43,686 --> 01:21:46,122
All these problems you
brought into my life.

1327
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:49,307
I'm losing my mind, they'll be
dropping a net on me!

1328
01:21:49,498 --> 01:21:51,568
Problems? What, for instance?

1329
01:21:51,792 --> 01:21:54,890
"Problems? What, for instance?"

1330
01:21:55,509 --> 01:21:57,735
Well, Shirley May, for instance.

1331
01:21:58,690 --> 01:22:02,428
You brought this department store Magdalene
into our house,

1332
01:22:02,453 --> 01:22:04,247
and how did she repay our kindness?

1333
01:22:04,339 --> 01:22:06,639
By trying to put her hooks into my brother!

1334
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,841
Oh, I'll admit Claude's no angel,

1335
01:22:09,099 --> 01:22:11,340
but I can assure you,
I'm not going to stand aside

1336
01:22:11,365 --> 01:22:13,561
and see him wind up
with that alley-cat.

1337
01:22:14,743 --> 01:22:16,518
My mother would turn over in her grave.

1338
01:22:16,567 --> 01:22:17,958
- She would, huh?
- Yes.

1339
01:22:18,153 --> 01:22:20,156
And any girl who tries
to commit suicide

1340
01:22:20,181 --> 01:22:22,548
because a married man gets tired
of paying her expenses

1341
01:22:22,573 --> 01:22:25,418
and tosses her out on her ear,
is hardly the catch of the season!

1342
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:27,118
Even for my brother!

1343
01:22:27,213 --> 01:22:29,355
Listen, I know your brother
better than you do.

1344
01:22:29,428 --> 01:22:31,623
He might be better off
with a couple of hooks in him.

1345
01:22:31,824 --> 01:22:32,986
- Oh...
- She marrying him is

1346
01:22:33,011 --> 01:22:35,649
like her jumping out of the frying pan
into your family!

1347
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,258
Don't change the subject!

1348
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:39,878
Are you going to ask her to get out,
or am I?

1349
01:22:40,143 --> 01:22:40,929
And...

1350
01:22:45,691 --> 01:22:46,387
Claude...

1351
01:22:48,323 --> 01:22:50,450
I'm sorry you had to hear it all this way.

1352
01:22:51,415 --> 01:22:53,786
Somehow I planned to tell you
in my own words,

1353
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:55,941
a little differently.

1354
01:22:58,147 --> 01:23:00,744
I probably would have left myself
down a lot easier.

1355
01:23:14,195 --> 01:23:15,971
Now look what you made me say!

1356
01:23:17,675 --> 01:23:18,608
Me?

1357
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:25,178
- Good evening.
- Hello there.

1358
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:26,609
We are Mr. and Mrs. Adams.

1359
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:27,906
Used to be next door neighbors.

1360
01:23:27,931 --> 01:23:28,970
Well, won't you come in?

1361
01:23:28,995 --> 01:23:31,541
Thank you. You heard what the
man said. Come on, little mother.

1362
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,528
Take it easy now, take it easy.

1363
01:23:38,824 --> 01:23:40,379
We're old friends of the Claytons.

1364
01:23:40,430 --> 01:23:44,802
And we're a little high.
- Not me, he's been drinking my drinks too.

1365
01:23:45,081 --> 01:23:47,605
You may not know, but Sam Clayton is the
dearest friend I've got.

1366
01:23:47,630 --> 01:23:50,427
You know, if it weren't for Sam,
my wife wouldn't be having a baby.

1367
01:23:50,782 --> 01:23:51,866
Ah, here they are!

1368
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:55,345
I give you our dear friends,
and benefactors...

1369
01:23:55,729 --> 01:23:57,657
Two hearts of gold
in three quarter time.

1370
01:23:57,743 --> 01:23:58,884
Come on, little gypsy.

1371
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,928
Don't you like to waltz?

1372
01:24:05,140 --> 01:24:06,795
What have we got to waltz about?

1373
01:24:07,278 --> 01:24:09,808
We're celebrating, Mrs. Clayton.
We've had a few drinks.

1374
01:24:09,872 --> 01:24:11,694
- Ah, ah!
- I mean, I had the drinks.

1375
01:24:11,784 --> 01:24:14,586
What have you been drinking? Gasoline?
Wouldn't they buy it?

1376
01:24:15,057 --> 01:24:18,814
They not only bought all of the gasoline,
they bought the whole station!

1377
01:24:18,937 --> 01:24:20,823
Sam, I tell you, it's unbelievable.

1378
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,381
A guy pulls into the station,
and he says "Fill'er up!".

1379
01:24:23,832 --> 01:24:25,018
He says that he likes me.

1380
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:28,035
He says he's been watching me on the corner,
and counting the trucks going by.

1381
01:24:28,372 --> 01:24:30,728
In short, he'd like to purchase
my growing business.

1382
01:24:30,979 --> 01:24:33,155
I think he probably noticed
the way we're "expanding".

1383
01:24:35,236 --> 01:24:36,350
He wanted some air.

1384
01:24:37,917 --> 01:24:39,133
- Who's this?
- Claude.

1385
01:24:39,327 --> 01:24:40,809
- How are you?
- Glad to know you.

1386
01:24:41,168 --> 01:24:43,573
Out of the clear sky he says,
"Bud, what do you want for the station?"

1387
01:24:43,959 --> 01:24:47,975
Without laughing I says, "12,500, with
the little house in the rear thrown in."

1388
01:24:48,254 --> 01:24:50,789
And without laughing he says,
"I'll take it."

1389
01:24:50,814 --> 01:24:52,872
And it's his.
And here's your share!

1390
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:54,865
I made it out for a thousand more.

1391
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,852
Oh, no, you shouldn't-

1392
01:24:55,877 --> 01:24:58,597
Don't argue, we both did alright
on that deal, thanks to both of you.

1393
01:24:58,815 --> 01:25:01,423
I bought another place up the line.
You're in on that too, if you want.

1394
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:03,476
Believe me, if I can ever do you a favour...

1395
01:25:03,502 --> 01:25:06,386
Well, you could give Claude a job,
he'll sell a lot of gas for you.

1396
01:25:06,411 --> 01:25:08,547
He's got one! Here, look me up, Claude.

1397
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:10,541
- Good.
- Now, you want to celebrate?

1398
01:25:10,602 --> 01:25:12,071
Wanna dance the night away?

1399
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,041
Ha- Hardly in the mood for that...

1400
01:25:14,066 --> 01:25:17,514
Well, pardon the intrusion.
Come on, little mother.

1401
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:24,452
I think I'll go along.

1402
01:25:24,477 --> 01:25:26,162
No use getting stiff, you know.

1403
01:25:46,503 --> 01:25:47,523
Lu,

1404
01:25:47,979 --> 01:25:49,761
somebody paid us back.

1405
01:25:52,197 --> 01:25:56,803
I'm glad for a l- a lot of reasons.
I'm glad for them, and I'm glad for myself.

1406
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,676
Kinda... renews your faith in people.

1407
01:26:04,655 --> 01:26:08,297
You know, it's... funny, Lu, we're so close
in so many ways,

1408
01:26:08,335 --> 01:26:12,296
and yet we seem to differ on things
that I think are important...

1409
01:26:13,675 --> 01:26:15,281
I wish we'd get together on...

1410
01:26:15,527 --> 01:26:17,621
what is really valuable in life.

1411
01:26:19,508 --> 01:26:22,411
I find happiness in different things
than you do.

1412
01:26:25,208 --> 01:26:27,040
I guess I did go overboard in...

1413
01:26:27,347 --> 01:26:31,204
helping them, and not thinking
about you and your home.

1414
01:26:32,459 --> 01:26:34,629
And I realize both are important.

1415
01:26:34,875 --> 01:26:38,912
But... you weren't there when I
talked to the two of them.

1416
01:26:39,268 --> 01:26:43,503
It seemed so right to tell them they
must have the baby,

1417
01:26:44,150 --> 01:26:47,232
and they'd regret it the rest of their lives
if they didn't

1418
01:26:48,898 --> 01:26:51,857
Years later they'd find themselves saying,

1419
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:55,917
"He'd be sixteen now..."

1420
01:26:58,510 --> 01:26:59,970
Well, that's about it.

1421
01:27:00,037 --> 01:27:02,631
The house seemed awfully unimportant
at that moment.

1422
01:27:04,232 --> 01:27:07,854
Maybe... Maybe I'm unbalanced
and my scales need adjusting,

1423
01:27:07,880 --> 01:27:12,420
but when I... when I put some things on one side

1424
01:27:12,445 --> 01:27:14,399
and material things on the other

1425
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:16,389
my scales go this way.

1426
01:27:17,173 --> 01:27:21,479
Gosh. I'll never change, Lu,
because that's the way I am.

1427
01:27:22,633 --> 01:27:25,263
So... while you're in Paris...

1428
01:27:25,703 --> 01:27:27,396
Who's going to Paris?

1429
01:27:33,815 --> 01:27:37,668
Well... thanks again for everything.

1430
01:27:41,943 --> 01:27:45,178
I'll be alright, Mr. Clayton.
I'm going to stay with Ruthie.

1431
01:27:57,512 --> 01:27:59,974
Lu, we made a profit on people...

1432
01:28:00,710 --> 01:28:04,080
Now we can buy the house, and...
maybe live happily ever after, hmm?

1433
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:21,349
Claude, I feel badly enough now.

1434
01:28:22,164 --> 01:28:24,988
Why don't you go home to your sister,
she's told you all about me!

1435
01:28:27,821 --> 01:28:30,615
That's probably my sister now.
She told me she was coming over to see you.

1436
01:28:30,796 --> 01:28:33,019
Oh, no. No, Claude. I don't want to
see your sister.

1437
01:28:33,340 --> 01:28:34,205
Why not?

1438
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:34,984
Well...

1439
01:28:35,009 --> 01:28:36,370
Why not? It would be nice to people.

1440
01:28:37,266 --> 01:28:39,330
She shot off her big mouth,
and she's sorry.

1441
01:28:39,863 --> 01:28:44,259
She just wants to tell you so.
Come on... Give her a break.

1442
01:28:48,968 --> 01:28:50,462
Come on in, sis.

1443
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:55,886
I just came by to show her
my new uniform.

1444
01:28:57,723 --> 01:29:00,492
Tell her I love her,
and all she has to do is set the date.

1445
01:29:00,988 --> 01:29:03,102
Lu, you can take it up from there
as to what she needs.

1446
01:29:03,221 --> 01:29:06,230
Flowers, the right clothes,
you know all about those things.

1447
01:29:07,503 --> 01:29:09,101
And make her look lovely, Lu.

1448
01:29:09,931 --> 01:29:13,233
You know, after all, I couldn't be seen
with a dowdy bride.

1449
01:29:14,059 --> 01:29:15,247
Good bye.

1450
01:29:27,575 --> 01:29:28,742
May I sit down?

1451
01:29:34,604 --> 01:29:36,419
Is there something else wrong with me?

1452
01:29:37,048 --> 01:29:41,851
Didn't you say it all yesterday?
What else is on your mind? Say it!

1453
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:49,729
I was just wondering if my wedding dress
could be altered to fit you.

1454
01:29:50,068 --> 01:29:51,308
I think it could.

1455
01:29:51,767 --> 01:29:54,318
Oh, that is, of course, if you like blue.

1456
01:29:55,258 --> 01:29:57,777
Oh, it would go wonderfully
with your hair and eyes.

1457
01:29:57,965 --> 01:30:00,173
And I would be more than happy
if you'd wear it.

1458
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,987
I could bring it over,
and you could try it on, huh?

1459
01:30:03,686 --> 01:30:06,681
Oh, but... you'll have some
ideas of your own.

1460
01:30:07,006 --> 01:30:08,811
You'd look lovely in white too.

1461
01:30:09,860 --> 01:30:11,588
Oh, I love blue.

1462
01:30:13,161 --> 01:30:16,693
Mrs. Clayton, I will make your brother
the best wife a man ever had.

1463
01:30:17,651 --> 01:30:22,190
But I want to straighten you out about me.
I'm not really as bad as you think I am.

1464
01:30:22,305 --> 01:30:26,503
Oh, please, please don't.
Come on, let's talk about shoes.

1465
01:30:27,091 --> 01:30:29,799
I know exactly where to buy them,
believe me.

1466
01:30:30,297 --> 01:30:31,656
And... oh...

1467
01:30:32,018 --> 01:30:32,866
Oh, yes.

1468
01:30:33,060 --> 01:30:34,161
The hat!

1469
01:30:34,646 --> 01:30:37,037
I love your brother so much!

1470
01:30:37,242 --> 01:30:41,419
Oh, I do too. But I want to warn you,
you're marrying a screwball.

1471
01:30:41,810 --> 01:30:44,710
I know, but I understand it.

1472
01:30:45,597 --> 01:30:47,601
- You do?
- Yes.

1473
01:30:48,889 --> 01:30:51,916
I guess we have two of the most
wonderful men in the world.

1474
01:30:51,969 --> 01:30:55,246
I know I have.
But you can speak for yourself.

1475
01:30:55,582 --> 01:30:58,169
I will admit that Claude's
a little different.

1476
01:30:58,756 --> 01:30:59,649
I guess...

1477
01:30:59,921 --> 01:31:03,731
Let's say that at the moment you have
the most wonderful husband in the world!

1478
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:07,192
- Did you see the morning paper?
- No.

1479
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,319
Look.

1480
01:31:43,210 --> 01:31:44,192
Hello there!

1481
01:31:44,217 --> 01:31:46,143
Well, hello, it's nice to see you.

1482
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,150
Thank you.

1483
01:31:47,245 --> 01:31:50,625
- What have you been doing?
- I've been taking lessons on the 3rd floor.

1484
01:31:50,784 --> 01:31:52,450
Well, how- how are you doing?

1485
01:31:52,483 --> 01:31:55,337
How I'm doing?... Ha, look!

1486
01:31:55,374 --> 01:31:57,553
Argyle!
- Oh... Pretty!

1487
01:31:57,709 --> 01:31:59,028
You get the first pair.

1488
01:31:59,109 --> 01:32:01,465
What size do you wear?
- Um... eleven and a half.

1489
01:32:01,490 --> 01:32:02,560
I'll make them twelve.

1490
01:32:02,585 --> 01:32:04,326
You may grow a little,
they may shrink a little.

1491
01:32:04,351 --> 01:32:05,151
Mr. Clayton.

1492
01:32:05,487 --> 01:32:07,150
Here's the money from the
fourth and fifth floors.

1493
01:32:07,175 --> 01:32:10,044
They came through one hundred percent.
That's everybody...

1494
01:32:10,144 --> 01:32:11,415
Except Mr. Borden.

1495
01:32:11,770 --> 01:32:13,091
What goes on here?

1496
01:32:13,389 --> 01:32:16,320
You see, every year Mr. Clayton
gives a Christmas dinner for the destitute.

1497
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:18,463
Everybody in the store contributes to it.

1498
01:32:18,625 --> 01:32:21,382
I must get in on this.
You know, I go to school here.

1499
01:32:21,597 --> 01:32:23,002
- Oh, thank you.
- Say...

1500
01:32:23,294 --> 01:32:25,219
With all that money,
you ought to get to the bank.

1501
01:32:25,575 --> 01:32:28,352
Before someone bumps you on the head.
- That's right where I'm going.

1502
01:32:29,870 --> 01:32:31,044
- Bye.
- Bye.

1503
01:32:37,392 --> 01:32:38,336
Hello, Mr. Clayton.

1504
01:32:38,367 --> 01:32:39,502
Joe, sorry to keep you waiting.

1505
01:32:39,527 --> 01:32:41,036
- All right.
- Where's the turkeys?

1506
01:32:41,073 --> 01:32:44,302
Over in the truck.
Three more loads coming.

1507
01:32:44,780 --> 01:32:47,780
Best bunch I ever raised, too.
Here's the bill.

1508
01:32:48,668 --> 01:32:50,133
Hey, you raised the price too!

1509
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:52,641
Oh, well, feed and everything's
going up, you know.

1510
01:32:52,931 --> 01:32:55,382
Here, I have it all made out
except for the amount.

1511
01:33:01,554 --> 01:33:02,529
Thanks, Joe.

1512
01:33:02,554 --> 01:33:03,902
Oh, thank you, Mr. Clayton.

1513
01:33:04,237 --> 01:33:05,755
Well, merry Christmas!

1514
01:33:05,871 --> 01:33:08,123
- Thank you very much. The same to you.
- Call you next year!

1515
01:33:08,232 --> 01:33:09,129
Bye.

1516
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:18,496
Here, more ice.

1517
01:33:22,936 --> 01:33:24,741
Say, I shouldn't be here.
What time-

1518
01:33:24,898 --> 01:33:26,951
Hey, she took my watch too!

1519
01:33:27,289 --> 01:33:28,535
What happened?

1520
01:33:29,693 --> 01:33:32,907
Well, all I know is that somebody
hit me on the head, from behind.

1521
01:33:35,439 --> 01:33:37,455
How'd she get you up here anyway?

1522
01:33:38,126 --> 01:33:39,517
She had a heart attack!

1523
01:33:43,112 --> 01:33:45,209
She said she didn't want me
to take her to the hospital.

1524
01:33:45,481 --> 01:33:47,175
She'd be all right if I brought her home,

1525
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:48,461
so I brought her here.

1526
01:33:49,335 --> 01:33:51,620
I asked her if she'd had these spells before.

1527
01:33:51,765 --> 01:33:54,547
She said only after she lost the baby.

1528
01:33:55,235 --> 01:33:56,627
Oh, the baby...

1529
01:33:59,368 --> 01:34:02,645
What's the idea walking around
with all this money on you?

1530
01:34:02,858 --> 01:34:04,209
Haven't you got a bank?

1531
01:34:04,595 --> 01:34:05,784
Yeah, I-...

1532
01:34:07,306 --> 01:34:08,122
The bank...

1533
01:34:08,637 --> 01:34:10,609
Oh, yes, I've got to get to the bank!

1534
01:34:13,579 --> 01:34:15,759
Say, you did get a bump,
didn't you?

1535
01:34:16,071 --> 01:34:17,040
Feeling better?

1536
01:34:17,065 --> 01:34:18,525
Yeah, I feel fine...

1537
01:34:22,105 --> 01:34:24,355
You see, Al, the way it is,

1538
01:34:24,379 --> 01:34:28,679
I actually paid for the turkeys out of
the money I was supposed to buy a house with.

1539
01:34:30,339 --> 01:34:34,788
Now I've lost the employees' money,
I've got to raise quite a chunk of dough.

1540
01:34:35,557 --> 01:34:37,715
Is there no way the bank could
loan me enough?

1541
01:34:38,139 --> 01:34:41,010
Well, Sam, I'd like to help you,
but my hands are tied.

1542
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:43,615
You're on too many people's notes now.

1543
01:34:43,687 --> 01:34:46,087
You were a bad risk
before this happened, and...

1544
01:34:46,338 --> 01:34:48,456
now you're in a terrible mess.

1545
01:34:50,374 --> 01:34:52,494
Yeah, I guess unless I can
think of something...

1546
01:34:52,957 --> 01:34:54,452
we've lost our new home.

1547
01:34:57,778 --> 01:34:59,575
Sorry I couldn't help you, Sam.

1548
01:35:01,236 --> 01:35:02,519
Have another drink.

1549
01:35:02,909 --> 01:35:05,938
Just one, I- I clunk up my head,
and it makes me.... woozy.

1550
01:35:06,098 --> 01:35:08,188
I'll have one with you.

1551
01:35:15,225 --> 01:35:19,158
So Sam, here's to hoping you somehow you...
have a very merry Christmas.

1552
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:29,507
- Hey, will you clear the driveway for me?
- Sure.

1553
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:07,436
Sam! Why home so early?

1554
01:36:07,926 --> 01:36:10,992
Oh darling, this is absolutely the
happiest day of my life!

1555
01:36:11,137 --> 01:36:13,264
And have I got news for you!
Guess what?

1556
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:15,330
Lu... Where are they taking our-
our sofa!

1557
01:36:15,355 --> 01:36:18,833
Sam, listen, the Nelsons are letting us
move into the new house right now.

1558
01:36:18,858 --> 01:36:20,100
Isn't that wonderful?

1559
01:36:20,126 --> 01:36:21,501
Y- y- yeah...

1560
01:36:21,786 --> 01:36:24,652
Well, you look more surprised
than delighted, darling.

1561
01:36:24,893 --> 01:36:27,849
Oh, Sam, you've been right, and
I've been wrong about so many things.

1562
01:36:27,909 --> 01:36:29,211
- I have?

1563
01:36:29,944 --> 01:36:31,498
Lu, where are they taking our...

1564
01:36:31,523 --> 01:36:32,756
That's what I mean.

1565
01:36:32,909 --> 01:36:34,615
I gave all the furniture away!

1566
01:36:34,725 --> 01:36:36,643
You gave the furniture away?
Well, stop them Lu!

1567
01:36:36,668 --> 01:36:38,542
Why? Oh, look, Sam.

1568
01:36:38,621 --> 01:36:41,718
Now it can be told.
I'm sick of looking at it.

1569
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:43,635
I'm tired of every piece.

1570
01:36:43,757 --> 01:36:45,839
The second-hand dealers
would give us little to nothing,

1571
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,856
so I called the Salvation Army.

1572
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:49,420
Why not give it to them?

1573
01:36:49,588 --> 01:36:51,566
I felt that's what you'd want me to do.

1574
01:36:51,816 --> 01:36:54,040
It will help brighten some
poor family's Christmas,

1575
01:36:54,065 --> 01:36:56,030
help make it as merry
as our is going to be.

1576
01:36:56,647 --> 01:36:58,931
Oh... What's the matter, darling?
What's wrong?

1577
01:36:59,555 --> 01:37:01,620
Oh, nothing. What made you say that?

1578
01:37:02,089 --> 01:37:03,732
You've been working too hard.

1579
01:37:03,871 --> 01:37:06,374
That annual Christmas dinner
must be an awful headache!

1580
01:37:06,682 --> 01:37:10,079
Yes, it is. You're... giving...
everything away, huh?

1581
01:37:10,156 --> 01:37:12,464
Sure. And I got another
big surprise for you!

1582
01:37:12,944 --> 01:37:13,931
Another surprise?

1583
01:37:14,243 --> 01:37:16,717
- Ready, Mrs. Clayton?
- Oh, be right with you.

1584
01:37:17,720 --> 01:37:18,754
Where are you going?

1585
01:37:19,039 --> 01:37:20,400
That's the other surprise.

1586
01:37:20,720 --> 01:37:23,280
We are going to have dinner tonight
in our own new home.

1587
01:37:23,420 --> 01:37:24,965
Chloe's out buying everything.

1588
01:37:25,159 --> 01:37:28,198
And it will consist of all your
favourite dishes, including me.

1589
01:37:32,056 --> 01:37:35,956
Oh, and don't come home till six thirty.
I want everything to be just right!

1590
01:37:36,078 --> 01:37:39,775
And to give you a rough idea,
dinner starts with a... surprise!

1591
01:37:39,839 --> 01:37:41,484
Flown in at great expense!

1592
01:37:43,595 --> 01:37:46,126
Good bye!
See you in paradise!

1593
01:38:02,249 --> 01:38:04,769
So you called up everybody
that owes you money.

1594
01:38:05,263 --> 01:38:05,947
Yeah.

1595
01:38:05,972 --> 01:38:08,244
- They wouldn't give you a dime, huh?
- No.

1596
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:10,492
Well, they'll do it every time.

1597
01:38:10,733 --> 01:38:13,813
Everybody I asked said I couldn't
have picked a worse time.

1598
01:38:15,234 --> 01:38:17,434
"Glad to pay you, Sam, but not now."

1599
01:38:18,042 --> 01:38:19,349
Just when I need it!

1600
01:38:21,222 --> 01:38:24,782
"I'd love to pay you, Sam,
but you know what doctors' bills are."

1601
01:38:25,105 --> 01:38:27,322
"Just got on my feet,
when I broke my leg."

1602
01:38:29,031 --> 01:38:32,707
"Sorry, Sam, but three boys in the hospital..."

1603
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:35,582
No, "three boys in the college..."

1604
01:38:36,214 --> 01:38:40,700
"... and my mother-in-law in a tent..."
Oxygen tent.

1605
01:38:40,827 --> 01:38:41,886
Oh!

1606
01:38:42,309 --> 01:38:45,068
"But don't you worry, you'll get it
if it's the last thing I ever do!

1607
01:38:45,093 --> 01:38:46,255
But not right now...

1608
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:47,405
Not right now.

1609
01:38:48,051 --> 01:38:50,797
- "Can you wait till April?"
- Yeah, some April!

1610
01:38:50,932 --> 01:38:54,681
Yeah, people are all alike, Sam.
I know what you mean.

1611
01:38:55,274 --> 01:38:57,048
I wish I could help you, but...

1612
01:38:57,521 --> 01:39:01,572
I had a bookmaker in here taking bets,
and it was only last month that he

1613
01:39:01,639 --> 01:39:04,053
ran away with all the cash I had.

1614
01:39:04,951 --> 01:39:06,973
Must have been quite a blow
to your wife.

1615
01:39:07,110 --> 01:39:08,679
No, she ran with him.

1616
01:39:10,537 --> 01:39:12,189
Maybe I should buy you a drink.

1617
01:39:12,425 --> 01:39:14,733
Well, I could stand one right now, thanks.

1618
01:39:16,353 --> 01:39:19,608
Mrs. Clayton, you look gorgeous!

1619
01:39:19,851 --> 01:39:23,477
Yes, and I hope Mr. Clayton will forget
what it cost when he sees me in it.

1620
01:39:23,502 --> 01:39:24,686
He will.

1621
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:28,693
Mommy, when will Daddy come home?

1622
01:39:28,771 --> 01:39:29,921
Any minute now, dear.

1623
01:39:29,959 --> 01:39:31,315
We're hungry, Mommy.

1624
01:39:31,563 --> 01:39:34,524
Oh, would you come on, show Mommy what
you're going to do when Daddy gets home?

1625
01:39:34,549 --> 01:39:36,117
- Come on, Chloe.
- Alright.

1626
01:39:36,970 --> 01:39:39,081
Backstage, everybody!

1627
01:39:42,698 --> 01:39:45,735
Be sure and start together now.
Remember your finish?

1628
01:39:45,800 --> 01:39:46,649
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes.

1629
01:39:46,692 --> 01:39:50,549
All right, now here comes Daddy.

1630
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:55,231
Good evening, Daddy dear,
we're glad you're here,

1631
01:39:55,256 --> 01:39:57,625
So nice to welcome you!

1632
01:39:58,172 --> 01:40:02,560
All of us and Chloe want
to show you we're glad to see you!

1633
01:40:02,795 --> 01:40:08,499
And now you'll be so glad to hear
we have some happy news for you,

1634
01:40:08,952 --> 01:40:13,684
Now that we have a better home,
we'll all be better too!

1635
01:40:15,191 --> 01:40:16,961
We'd better be better!

1636
01:40:21,151 --> 01:40:22,805
I didn't say anything, pardon me.

1637
01:40:23,775 --> 01:40:24,601
Right...

1638
01:40:26,205 --> 01:40:29,327
You- You know what Confucius said
about helping people?

1639
01:40:29,504 --> 01:40:33,190
Yeah, he- he says so many things,
he's got me all mixed up.

1640
01:40:33,654 --> 01:40:34,798
Well, he said-

1641
01:40:34,823 --> 01:40:38,038
Confucius fills me with confusion!

1642
01:40:40,186 --> 01:40:43,553
Everybody said it, I got a whole book
full of 'em at home.

1643
01:40:44,269 --> 01:40:47,012
There's an old Scottish proverb, says, uh...

1644
01:40:48,466 --> 01:40:51,150
"Do a man a good turn, and they'll
never forgi'e ya."

1645
01:40:51,435 --> 01:40:53,571
"Forgi'e" is "forgive" in Scottish.

1646
01:40:53,624 --> 01:40:59,473
Yeah, I know, I know... I saw Harry Lauder
at the Palace, back in, uh... 1917.

1647
01:40:59,845 --> 01:41:02,499
- Allow me to quote.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

1648
01:41:02,867 --> 01:41:05,798
"He who has drunk his fill
turns his back on the filly."

1649
01:41:06,241 --> 01:41:09,342
Well, I kind of like that, uh...
there's a guy that's been around!

1650
01:41:09,575 --> 01:41:10,995
Yeah. No, but that isn't right.

1651
01:41:11,020 --> 01:41:17,111
"He... He who has drunk his fill
turns his back on the well."

1652
01:41:19,132 --> 01:41:21,422
It's a little dull that way,
don't you think?

1653
01:41:28,318 --> 01:41:30,243
Well, maybe he worked late at the store, Lu.

1654
01:41:30,337 --> 01:41:32,130
Why didn't he telephone that?

1655
01:41:34,816 --> 01:41:38,072
Did Daddy know we were going to have
black raspberry ice cream?

1656
01:41:38,698 --> 01:41:41,645
No, dear. We were going to surprise him.

1657
01:41:43,462 --> 01:41:46,436
Do you think something
happened to him, Mommy?

1658
01:41:46,709 --> 01:41:49,677
Oh, no! No, your Daddy's all right.

1659
01:41:49,702 --> 01:41:51,182
Maybe he isn't.

1660
01:41:55,881 --> 01:41:57,839
- Even the Arabs warned me.
- Uh-huh?

1661
01:41:57,906 --> 01:42:03,318
They said, "Sam, do no good,
and you will suffer no ingratitude"

1662
01:42:03,870 --> 01:42:06,896
Look at the clothes they wear.
No pockets!

1663
01:42:07,780 --> 01:42:10,849
Ask an Arab for a buck, and he'll
silently fold up his tent and...

1664
01:42:10,874 --> 01:42:12,380
silently steal away.

1665
01:42:12,568 --> 01:42:13,464
Yeah.

1666
01:42:14,032 --> 01:42:15,627
How about a drink, pal?

1667
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:19,078
Oh, no... On your way now, putty face.
Fall apart outside, will you?

1668
01:42:19,103 --> 01:42:22,244
Oh, I gotta have a drink.
I've had it tough, pals, believe me!

1669
01:42:22,271 --> 01:42:23,565
I've seen better days.

1670
01:42:23,590 --> 01:42:27,229
Well then, go ahead and live on your memory.
Now get out of here, will you?

1671
01:42:28,376 --> 01:42:30,288
Come on back, friend, I'll buy you a drink.

1672
01:42:31,696 --> 01:42:35,874
Oh, I don't get you, Sam.
There you go again!

1673
01:42:36,327 --> 01:42:39,987
But, Tom, there is some good in everybody.

1674
01:42:40,304 --> 01:42:43,110
Well, the only thing in him that's
any good is my whiskey.

1675
01:42:43,204 --> 01:42:48,644
Some people are less fortunate than we are.
All they need is a helping hand.

1676
01:42:50,339 --> 01:42:51,943
Oh, I do, do I?

1677
01:42:55,683 --> 01:42:59,717
I can't remember when I heard
a more stupid remark.

1678
01:43:01,006 --> 01:43:05,695
You're not really helping me, all you're
doing is bolstering your own ego.

1679
01:43:07,730 --> 01:43:11,650
So he bought me a couple of lousy drinks...
and now he feels good about it.

1680
01:43:11,728 --> 01:43:13,422
All warm inside.

1681
01:43:15,013 --> 01:43:16,798
I bet you feel better than I do!

1682
01:43:16,863 --> 01:43:19,802
Oh, why don't you get out of here,
you crumpled bum?

1683
01:43:19,842 --> 01:43:22,069
This guy has got his own troubles.

1684
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,420
- He has got trouble!?
- Yeah!

1685
01:43:23,445 --> 01:43:25,199
- He's got trouble!
- Yes!

1686
01:43:25,224 --> 01:43:28,772
He's one of the upper ten!
He's got everything.

1687
01:43:30,230 --> 01:43:32,371
You can afford to be condescending.

1688
01:43:32,823 --> 01:43:35,322
Dressed in the height of fashion!

1689
01:43:36,002 --> 01:43:39,957
Look at his clothes. Look!
Look at mine!

1690
01:43:40,161 --> 01:43:43,550
Yeah, well, just keep that up,
and he'll give you his.

1691
01:43:43,875 --> 01:43:47,818
That I want to see, my friend!
That I want to see!

1692
01:43:48,197 --> 01:43:51,407
There's a lot of fine talk in this world,
but no action!

1693
01:43:51,437 --> 01:43:52,429
- No action?
- No action.

1694
01:43:52,475 --> 01:43:54,428
Well, you're gonna see
some action now, buddy!

1695
01:43:54,453 --> 01:43:55,904
That's what I want, action!

1696
01:43:55,929 --> 01:44:00,387
- Hey, what are you doing there?
- I'm gonna call a wagon and put that bug in jug!

1697
01:44:01,785 --> 01:44:04,195
No, no, don't...
Come back... bug!

1698
01:44:07,511 --> 01:44:10,115
Why don't you go to bed
and sleep it off?

1699
01:44:11,072 --> 01:44:12,933
There you go again.

1700
01:44:13,389 --> 01:44:18,372
Sitting there, bedecked in your royal
arrayments, and laughing inwardly...

1701
01:44:19,835 --> 01:44:23,445
For you know I have no home,
and no bed on which to rest my head!

1702
01:44:23,569 --> 01:44:24,522
- No?
- No.

1703
01:44:24,547 --> 01:44:26,249
- I didn't know that.
- That's right.

1704
01:44:26,514 --> 01:44:28,408
- Well, I'll get you one.
- All right.

1705
01:44:29,740 --> 01:44:31,705
You want me to sleep well, don't you?

1706
01:44:37,890 --> 01:44:41,046
Thanks. Now don't forget to give him
the shirt off your back.

1707
01:44:41,838 --> 01:44:43,350
I'll- I'll be back.

1708
01:44:46,026 --> 01:44:47,793
Don't drop him in here!

1709
01:44:48,116 --> 01:44:50,286
And get him out of that woodwork, will you?

1710
01:44:50,610 --> 01:44:52,603
Get him out of here!

1711
01:44:55,815 --> 01:44:57,099
- How do you do?
- How'd'do?

1712
01:44:57,205 --> 01:45:00,271
- I'm Mr. Drew from the bank.
- Yes, sir.

1713
01:45:00,536 --> 01:45:01,856
I'd like to see Mr. Clayton.

1714
01:45:02,156 --> 01:45:04,608
Well, it's a bad time to see him.
He ain't here.

1715
01:45:05,665 --> 01:45:08,429
- Well then, could I see Mrs. Clayton?
- Well...

1716
01:45:08,905 --> 01:45:11,566
- It's rather important.
- Uh-huh, yes, sir.

1717
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:15,579
Well, you wait-... Oh, well,
why don't you better come in.

1718
01:45:36,771 --> 01:45:39,427
I feel that I'm directly responsible
for what happened.

1719
01:45:40,239 --> 01:45:44,193
I turned him down for a loan
because he had no security.

1720
01:45:45,762 --> 01:45:49,530
Then I got to thinking.
What kind of a world is this?

1721
01:45:49,963 --> 01:45:51,656
There must be something rotten somewhere

1722
01:45:51,681 --> 01:45:54,329
when a man like your husband
can't get a loan.

1723
01:45:55,097 --> 01:45:58,137
I'm not for revising the banking laws, but...

1724
01:45:58,459 --> 01:46:03,427
sometimes we should make an exception,
and take a good heart for security.

1725
01:46:05,879 --> 01:46:08,072
So rest assured,
this house is yours.

1726
01:46:09,087 --> 01:46:10,920
Oh, what wonderful news!

1727
01:46:11,384 --> 01:46:12,903
If only he were here!

1728
01:46:13,991 --> 01:46:19,623
I've made him feel that I wanted this
more than anything else in the world.

1729
01:46:20,568 --> 01:46:22,229
More than I wanted him.

1730
01:46:23,527 --> 01:46:24,928
Tommy! Tommy, my boy!

1731
01:46:24,953 --> 01:46:26,062
I want my stuff.

1732
01:46:27,233 --> 01:46:29,200
You've had enough now, Sam.
Go on home!

1733
01:46:29,670 --> 01:46:31,429
What am I gonna do with a guy like that?

1734
01:46:31,879 --> 01:46:32,909
Look at him now!

1735
01:46:33,035 --> 01:46:34,162
Come back here, will you?!

1736
01:46:34,187 --> 01:46:35,994
No, I want to be alone!

1737
01:46:39,477 --> 01:46:41,418
Am I gonna have trouble with you?

1738
01:46:41,658 --> 01:46:43,284
Not if you leave me alone!

1739
01:46:43,325 --> 01:46:45,454
Sam, you're a too nice a guy...

1740
01:46:45,479 --> 01:46:46,349
Who's a nice guy?

1741
01:46:46,374 --> 01:46:49,047
You are! Why, you haven't got
a mean streak in you!

1742
01:46:49,432 --> 01:46:52,543
- I haven't, huh?
- Well, I- Yes you have...

1743
01:46:53,080 --> 01:46:54,060
Give it to me, will you?

1744
01:46:54,172 --> 01:46:55,443
Give it to me, Sam.

1745
01:46:55,484 --> 01:46:56,619
Give me the...

1746
01:47:00,267 --> 01:47:03,798
From now on, I'm the meanest man in town!
Watch and see.

1747
01:47:03,823 --> 01:47:05,032
I'm commencing to believe it!

1748
01:47:05,078 --> 01:47:08,538
Watch the next person that comes up
for a helping hand. I'll...

1749
01:47:09,522 --> 01:47:12,084
The next character that comes up to me
with his hand out,

1750
01:47:12,115 --> 01:47:13,721
see what I do, I'll...

1751
01:47:14,275 --> 01:47:15,882
Oh, Sam!

1752
01:47:16,188 --> 01:47:17,517
Oh, sorry, miss.

1753
01:47:17,706 --> 01:47:18,902
I'm awful sorry.

1754
01:47:20,185 --> 01:47:22,144
He's a nice fellow when he's not drinking.

1755
01:47:22,572 --> 01:47:23,565
Come here.

1756
01:47:24,018 --> 01:47:25,098
He shouldn't have done that.

1757
01:47:25,203 --> 01:47:28,161
- Here, this will cover what's missing, maybe...
- Thank you.

1758
01:47:29,013 --> 01:47:30,062
Here, miss.

1759
01:47:30,819 --> 01:47:33,170
I wonder if you'll help me get
him out of here. Get him home.

1760
01:47:33,195 --> 01:47:34,623
- I'm sorry, miss.
- Don't.

1761
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:36,937
Thank you. All right, Sam.

1762
01:47:37,506 --> 01:47:38,886
You're all right.

1763
01:47:56,537 --> 01:48:01,830
Mid pleasures and palaces

1764
01:48:02,164 --> 01:48:05,833
though we may roam,

1765
01:48:06,073 --> 01:48:10,417
Be it ever so humble

1766
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:16,328
there's no place like home!

1767
01:48:16,753 --> 01:48:23,129
Home! Home! sweet, sweet Home!

1768
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:29,159
There's no place like Home!

1769
01:48:29,444 --> 01:48:35,461
Be it ever so humble,

1770
01:48:35,829 --> 01:48:41,645
O why don't you go home?

1771
01:48:42,503 --> 01:48:45,218
Home, home, sweet...

1772
01:48:46,298 --> 01:48:47,863
We'll find a bed for him.

1773
01:48:48,080 --> 01:48:49,573
- Oh, gee, will you, lady?
- Yes.

1774
01:48:49,698 --> 01:48:50,932
Oh, that's great!

1775
01:48:51,337 --> 01:48:53,555
That's fine. Here, take this, and...

1776
01:48:53,594 --> 01:48:54,889
I hope it helps out.

1777
01:48:54,944 --> 01:48:56,318
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1778
01:48:56,343 --> 01:48:58,313
- Come on.
- Oh, wait a minute, he's tied off.

1779
01:49:01,954 --> 01:49:03,090
Take it away!

1780
01:49:58,990 --> 01:50:00,178
Hello, Chloe, where's Sam?

1781
01:50:00,203 --> 01:50:02,110
- Mr. Sam ain't here.
- Not here?

1782
01:50:02,491 --> 01:50:03,378
Hello, Lu!

1783
01:50:03,601 --> 01:50:07,846
Hi, Claude. Have a cigar!
And will you have a cigar... Father?

1784
01:50:08,135 --> 01:50:11,125
And you, sir, have a cigar.
- Lu is here.

1785
01:50:11,757 --> 01:50:14,190
A baby boy. Eight pounds.

1786
01:50:14,447 --> 01:50:16,519
Little Sam!
Isn't it wonderful?

1787
01:50:19,143 --> 01:50:20,229
Well, what's the matter?

1788
01:50:20,660 --> 01:50:22,160
Do you think we have enough babies?

1789
01:50:23,464 --> 01:50:26,041
- Sam Clayton is missing.
- No...

1790
01:50:26,634 --> 01:50:29,152
There's something's happened to him.
We're terribly worried.

1791
01:50:29,799 --> 01:50:31,142
Well, what could happen to Sam?

1792
01:50:31,782 --> 01:50:33,965
Everybody loved him, he had no enemies.

1793
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:36,515
Why, he's to nice a guy to be missing.

1794
01:50:37,218 --> 01:50:38,706
Oh, he's bound to turn up.

1795
01:50:38,816 --> 01:50:40,166
Nobody would harm him!

1796
01:50:40,303 --> 01:50:44,138
Why, he took care of everybody.
And everybody will take care of him.

1797
01:50:44,934 --> 01:50:46,785
The world needs Sam Clayton!

1798
01:50:47,805 --> 01:50:49,147
So do I.

1799
01:51:31,494 --> 01:51:32,749
It's Sam!

1800
01:51:34,188 --> 01:51:35,660
Oh, no!

1801
01:51:59,526 --> 01:52:02,096
We found this address on him.
Is he your husband?

1802
01:52:03,316 --> 01:52:04,919
They're wonderful people, Lu!

1803
01:52:05,040 --> 01:52:06,206
Yes, dear.

1804
01:52:08,685 --> 01:52:11,992
I'm a failure, Lu.
I'm gonna join them!

1805
01:52:13,501 --> 01:52:16,519
You're much better off without me.
I'm no good for you, Lu.

1806
01:52:16,962 --> 01:52:20,429
You're still young and so attractive,
isn't she?

1807
01:52:20,551 --> 01:52:21,957
So are you, you big...

1808
01:52:21,982 --> 01:52:25,476
Oh, I've messed up our lives,
I just stumble along and...

1809
01:52:25,518 --> 01:52:28,901
You just stumbled into the vice-presidency
of the store!

1810
01:52:29,322 --> 01:52:30,183
Yes.

1811
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,994
According to the
banker man here,

1812
01:52:32,025 --> 01:52:35,087
he's going to loan us the money,
so the house will be ours too.

1813
01:52:36,158 --> 01:52:37,206
That's right!

1814
01:52:37,281 --> 01:52:38,836
And he hasn't been drinking!

1815
01:52:39,383 --> 01:52:40,573
Did you hear that?

1816
01:52:41,686 --> 01:52:45,219
I- I'm not a failure!
Do you take successful people too?

1817
01:52:45,416 --> 01:52:48,404
Thank you so much!
You are wonderful people!

1818
01:52:48,803 --> 01:52:50,963
I'm so glad I
gave you all my furniture,

1819
01:52:50,987 --> 01:52:52,639
because you brought him home safely!

1820
01:52:52,895 --> 01:52:54,936
Furniture up on the waters, I always say.

1821
01:52:54,961 --> 01:52:57,489
Won't you all come in the house
and have a great big slug of-

1822
01:52:57,514 --> 01:52:58,520
Hot chocolate?

1823
01:52:59,719 --> 01:53:00,815
Hot chocolate!

1824
01:53:01,021 --> 01:53:04,725
No thanks, I think we'd better be going.
Merry Christmas to you!

1825
01:53:04,885 --> 01:53:06,112
Merry Christmas.

1826
01:53:07,793 --> 01:53:09,937
Hey, wait a minute.
Just one more song, huh?

1827
01:53:10,379 --> 01:53:11,169
Alright.

1828
01:53:14,384 --> 01:53:16,054
What will it be?

1829
01:53:17,689 --> 01:53:18,513
I know!

1830
01:53:20,054 --> 01:53:23,553
Let me call you "sweetheart"

1831
01:53:24,891 --> 01:53:30,504
I'm in love with you,

1832
01:53:30,598 --> 01:53:34,653
Let me hear you whisper

1833
01:53:35,139 --> 01:53:38,793
That you love me too

1834
01:53:38,856 --> 01:53:40,525
All right, I love you too.

1835
01:53:41,676 --> 01:53:44,768
- Keep the love light burning
- Glowing.

1836
01:53:44,828 --> 01:53:49,468
Glowing in your eyes so blue

1837
01:53:50,843 --> 01:53:54,328
Let me call you sweetheart

1838
01:53:55,080 --> 01:53:56,120
I'm...



9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
