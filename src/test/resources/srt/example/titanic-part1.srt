all the way backto the '20s
when she was working as an actress.

yourfirst clue, Sherlock.

Her name was Rose Dawson backthen.
Then she marries this guy named Calvert.

They move to Cedar Rapids
and she punches out a couple of kids.

- Hi.

153
00:14:06,529 --> 00:14:09,832
Welcome to the Keldysh.

154
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,802

Hey. Hey!

155

- ( Knocking)
- Rose: Yes?

156

- Areyour staterooms all right?
- Rose: Oh,yes, very nice.

157
00:14:23,346 --> 00:14:26,516
Haveyou met
my granddaughter Lizzie?

158
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:29,218
She takes care of me.

159
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,354
We metjust
a few minutes ago.

160
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,923
Remember, Nana, up on deck?

161
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:36,592
There, that's nice.

162
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,362
Have to have my pictures
when I travel.

163
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:41,964
Can I getyou anything?
ls there anythingyou'd like?

164
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,234
Yes.

165
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,937
I would like to see my drawing.

166
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:03,085
Brock:
Louis XVI wore a fabulous stone

167
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:06,088
that was called
the Blue Diamond ofthe Crown

168
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,158
which disappeared in 1 792

169
00:15:09,225 --> 00:15:13,062
about the same time old Louis
lost everything from the neck up.

170
00:15:13,129 --> 00:15:17,767
The theory goes that
the crown diamond was chopped, too

171
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,804
recut into a heart-like shape that
became known as "Heart ofthe Ocean."

172
00:15:21,871 --> 00:15:24,574
Today it would be worth more
than the Hope Diamond.

173
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,611
It was a dreadful, heavything.
I onlywore it this once.

174
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:32,248
Lizzie:
You actuallythinkthis isyou, Nana?

175
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:36,085
It is me, dear.
Wasn't I a dish?

176
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:40,756
I tracked it down
through insurance records--

177
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:44,794
An old claim that was settled
underterms ofabsolute secrecy.

178
00:15:46,062 --> 00:15:48,865
Can you tell me
who the claimant was, Rose?

179
00:15:48,931 --> 00:15:51,534
I should imagine
someone named Hockley.

180
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:55,938
Brock: Nathan Hockley, that's right.
Pittsburgh steel tycoon.

181
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,940
Claim was for
a diamond necklace

182
00:15:58,007 --> 00:16:01,210
his son Caledon
bought his fiancee--you

183
00:16:01,277 --> 00:16:04,280
a week before
he sailed on Titanic.

184
00:16:04,347 --> 00:16:08,417
It was filed right
afterthe sinking

185
00:16:08,484 --> 00:16:11,554
so the diamond had to have
gone down with the ship.

186
00:16:12,989 --> 00:16:15,324
You see the date?

187
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,660
"April 1 4, 1 91 2."

188
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,429
Which means ifyour grandmother is
who she says she is

189
00:16:20,496 --> 00:16:23,633
she was wearing the diamond
the daythe Titanicsank.

190
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,203
And that makesyou
my new best friend.

191
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,674
These are some ofthe things
we recovered from your stateroom.

192
00:16:33,843 --> 00:16:36,579
This was mine.

193
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:39,482
How extraordinary!

194
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:43,019
And it looks the same as it did
the last time I saw it.

195
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:51,460
The reflection
has changed a bit.

196
00:16:54,997 --> 00:16:57,700
( GaspsQuietly)

197
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:10,546
Areyou readyto go
backto Titanic?

198
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:18,387
Lewis: Okay, here we go. She hits
the berg on the starboard side, right?

199
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:21,557
She kind of bumps along punching holes
like Morse code-- dit-dit-dit--

200
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:24,260
along the side,
below the waterline.

201
00:17:24,327 --> 00:17:26,495
Then the forward compartments
start to flood.

202
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:30,600
Now as the water level rises, it
spills overthe watertight bulkheads

203
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:33,402
which unfortunately
don't go any higherthan E deck.

204
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:37,039
So now as the bow goes down,
the stern rises up

205
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:40,843
slow at first, then faster
and faster until finally

206
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,513
she's got herwhole ass is sticking
up in the air and that's a big ass.

207
00:17:43,579 --> 00:17:47,283
We're talking
20,000, 30,000 tons, okay?

208
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:51,621
And the hull's not designed to deal
with that pressure, so what happens?

209
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:53,990
She splits,
right down to the keel

210
00:17:54,056 --> 00:17:56,325
and the stern
falls back level.

211
00:17:56,392 --> 00:18:02,298
Then as the bow sinks, it pulls the
stern vertical and finally detaches.

212
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,468
Now, the stern sectionjust
kind of bobs there like a cork

213
00:18:05,535 --> 00:18:10,006
for a couple of minutes, floods and
finally goes under about 2:20 a.m.

214
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:13,676
two hours and 40 minutes
afterthe collision.

215
00:18:13,743 --> 00:18:17,380
The bow section planes away
landing about a halfa mile away

216
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:20,216
going 20, 30 knots when
it hits the ocean floor.

221

somewhat different.

459
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:37,920
Which is why I'm not looking forward
tojumping in there afteryou.

460
00:40:37,987 --> 00:40:40,556
Like I said...

461
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:42,725
I don't have a choice.

462
00:40:46,662 --> 00:40:49,398
I guess I'm kind of hoping
you'll come back overthe rail

463
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:51,701
and get me offthe hook here.

464
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,337
You're crazy.

465
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:59,642
That's what everybody says,
but with all due respect, miss

466
00:40:59,709 --> 00:41:02,945
I'm not the one hanging off
the back ofa ship here.

467
00:41:03,012 --> 00:41:05,181
Come on.

468
00:41:05,248 --> 00:41:09,819
Come on, give meyour hand.
You don't want to do this.

469
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:25,201
Whew!

470
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:27,236
I'mJack Dawson.

471
00:41:28,271 --> 00:41:30,339
Rose Dewitt Bukater.

472
00:41:30,406 --> 00:41:33,509
I'm going to have to getyou
to write that one down.

473
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:37,547
Come on.

474
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:40,750
- ( Screams)
- ( Grunting)

475
00:41:40,817 --> 00:41:43,820
I gotyou! Come on.

476
00:41:43,886 --> 00:41:45,888
Come on!

477
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:50,960
( Screams)
Help! Please!

478
00:41:51,027 --> 00:41:52,895
Help! Please!

479
00:41:54,397 --> 00:41:57,099
- Please get me!
- Listen. Listen to me.

480
00:41:57,166 --> 00:42:01,270
I've gotyou. I won't let go.
Now pull yourself up. Come on.

481
00:42:01,337 --> 00:42:03,840
( Grunts)

482
00:42:03,906 --> 00:42:06,542
Come on. That's right.

483
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:09,078
You can do it.

484
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,685
I gotyou.

485
00:42:19,522 --> 00:42:22,625
What's all this?

486
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:32,068
You stand back!
And don't move an inch!

487
00:42:32,134 --> 00:42:35,671
- Fetch the master-at-arms!
- Care for a brandy?

488
00:42:35,738 --> 00:42:38,741
Cal: This is completely unacceptable!
What madeyou think

489
00:42:38,808 --> 00:42:40,877
thatyou could putyour hands
on myfiancee?

490
00:42:42,445 --> 00:42:44,814
- Look at me,you filth!
- Cal...

491
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,984
- What doyou thinkyou were doing?
- Cal, stop.

492
00:42:48,050 --> 00:42:51,487
- It was an accident.
- An accident?

493
00:42:51,554 --> 00:42:55,324
It was. Stupid really.

494
00:42:55,391 --> 00:42:58,628
I was leaning over,
and I slipped.

495
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:04,800
I was leaning far over
to see the, uh...

496
00:43:04,867 --> 00:43:07,436
uh... uh...
the, uh... uh...

497
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:10,606
- Propellers?
- propellers and I slipped.

498
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:14,210
And I would have gone overboard
but Mr. Dawson here saved me

499
00:43:14,277 --> 00:43:16,779
and almost went over himself.

500
00:43:16,846 --> 00:43:19,015
You wanted to see...
She wanted to see the propellers.

501
00:43:19,081 --> 00:43:22,485
Like I said,
women and machinery do not mix.

502
00:43:22,552 --> 00:43:25,021
Was that the way of it?

503
00:43:27,223 --> 00:43:29,859
Yeah. Yeah,
that was pretty much it.

504
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:33,696
Well, the boy's a hero then.
Good foryou, son. Well done.

505
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:38,000
So it's all's well
and backto our brandy, eh?

506
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:42,338
Look atyou. You must be freezing.
Let's getyou inside.

507
00:43:42,405 --> 00:43:44,874
Perhaps a little something
forthe boy.

508
00:43:47,076 --> 00:43:52,682
Ofcourse. Mr. Lovejoy,
I think a 20 should do it.

509
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:55,551
Is that the going rate
for saving the woman you love?

510
00:43:56,853 --> 00:44:00,022
Rose is displeased.
What to do?

511
00:44:01,257 --> 00:44:03,726
I know.

512
00:44:05,228 --> 00:44:08,731
Perhapsyou couldjoin us
for dinnertomorrow evening

513
00:44:08,798 --> 00:44:13,035
to regale our group
with...your heroic tale.

514
00:44:15,438 --> 00:44:17,406
Sure, count me in.

515
00:44:17,473 --> 00:44:20,476
Good. Settled then.

516
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:23,679
This should be interesting. Mmm.

517
00:44:27,884 --> 00:44:30,153
( Whistles)

518
00:44:31,454 --> 00:44:34,624
Can l, uh... bum a smoke?

519
00:44:43,032 --> 00:44:45,568
You'll want to tie those.

520
00:44:46,969 --> 00:44:48,604
It's interesting.

521
00:44:48,671 --> 00:44:51,274
Theyoung lady slips so suddenly
and you still had time

522
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,143
to removeyourjacket
and your shoes.

523
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:04,153
- ( Music BoxPlaying Tune)
- ( KnockAtDoor)

524
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,656
( DoorOpens)

525
00:45:09,992 --> 00:45:13,229
I knowyou've been melancholy.

526
00:45:13,296 --> 00:45:16,165
I don't pretend to know why.

527
00:45:17,934 --> 00:45:20,436
I intended to save this

528
00:45:20,503 --> 00:45:24,173
until the engagement gala

529
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,442
next week.

530
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:30,947
But I thought tonight.

531
00:45:31,013 --> 00:45:33,216
Good gracious.

532
00:45:33,282 --> 00:45:36,285
Perhaps as a reminder
of myfeelings foryou.

533
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:39,655
- Is it a...
- Diamond? Yes.

534
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:44,527
56 carats to be exact.

535
00:45:46,796 --> 00:45:49,532
It was worn by Louis XVI

536
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,034
and they called it
"Le CoeurDeLa Mer. "

537
00:45:52,101 --> 00:45:54,036
Both:
The Heart ofthe Ocean.

538
00:45:54,103 --> 00:45:56,038
Yes.

539
00:46:01,110 --> 00:46:03,045
It's overwhelming.

540
00:46:03,112 --> 00:46:06,048
Well, it's for royalty.

541
00:46:06,115 --> 00:46:08,551
We are royalty, Rose.

542
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:15,591
You know, there's nothing
I couldn't giveyou.

543
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:18,327
There's nothing I'd denyyou

544
00:46:18,394 --> 00:46:21,063
ifyou would not deny me.

545
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,836
Now open your heart
to me, Rose.

546
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:45,988
Jack: Well, I've been on my own since
I was 1 5 since myfolks died.

547
00:46:47,423 --> 00:46:49,358
And I had no
brothers or sisters

548
00:46:49,425 --> 00:46:51,828
or close kin in that part
ofthe country.

549
00:46:51,894 --> 00:46:55,198
So I lit on out ofthere
and I haven't been back since.

550
00:46:55,264 --> 00:46:59,936
You couldjust call me
a tumbleweed blowing in the wind.

551
00:47:00,002 --> 00:47:02,371
Well, Rose...

552
00:47:02,438 --> 00:47:04,874
we've walked about a mile
around this boat deck

553
00:47:04,941 --> 00:47:08,044
and chewed over how great
the weather's been and how I grew up

554
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,848
but I reckon that's not why
you came to talkto me, is it?

555
00:47:13,449 --> 00:47:15,852
- Mr. Dawson, l--
-Jack.

556
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,154
Jack...

557
00:47:18,221 --> 00:47:21,691
I want to thankyou
forwhatyou did.

558
00:47:21,757 --> 00:47:25,995
Notjust for... for pulling me back
but foryour discretion.

559
00:47:26,062 --> 00:47:27,997
You're welcome.

560
00:47:28,064 --> 00:47:33,402
Look, I know
whatyou must be thinking.

561
00:47:33,469 --> 00:47:37,306
Poor little rich girl.
What does she know about misery?

562
00:47:37,373 --> 00:47:41,978
No. No, that's not what
I was thinking.

563
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:44,680
What I was thinking was
what could have happened to this girl

564
00:47:44,747 --> 00:47:47,150
to make herthink
she had no way out?

565
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:51,654
Well, l--

566
00:47:51,721 --> 00:47:53,656
It was everything.

567
00:47:53,723 --> 00:47:57,093
It was mywhole world
and all the people in it

568
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,695
and the inertia of my life
plunging ahead

569
00:47:59,762 --> 00:48:02,698
and me, powerless to stop it.

570
00:48:02,765 --> 00:48:04,867
God! Look at that thing.

571
00:48:04,934 --> 00:48:07,937
You would have gone
straight to the bottom.

572
00:48:09,005 --> 00:48:11,340
500 invitations have gone out.

573
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:14,610
All of Philadelphia society
will be there

574
00:48:14,677 --> 00:48:16,913
and all the while
I feel I'm...

575
00:48:16,979 --> 00:48:19,248
standing in the middle
ofa crowded room

576
00:48:19,315 --> 00:48:22,251
screaming at the top of my lungs
and no one even looks up.

577
00:48:23,953 --> 00:48:26,389
Doyou love him?

578
00:48:26,455 --> 00:48:29,492
- Pardon me?
- Doyou love him?

579
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:32,662
You're being very rude.
You shouldn't be asking me this.

580
00:48:32,728 --> 00:48:36,833
Well, it's a simple question.
Doyou love the guy or not?

581
00:48:37,934 --> 00:48:40,136
This is not
a suitable conversation.

582
00:48:40,203 --> 00:48:44,273
-Why can'tyoujust answerthe question?
-( Nervous Laughter)

583
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:47,710
This is absurd. You don't know me,
and I don't knowyou

584
00:48:47,777 --> 00:48:50,446
and we are not having
this conversation at all.

585
00:48:50,513 --> 00:48:54,984
You are rude and uncouth
and presumptuous and I am leaving now.

586
00:48:55,051 --> 00:48:57,687
Jack. Mr. Dawson,
it's been a pleasure.

587
00:48:57,753 --> 00:49:00,356
I soughtyou out to thankyou
and now I have thanked you...

588
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:03,826
- And you've insulted me.
- Well,you deserved it.

589
00:49:03,893 --> 00:49:06,128
- Right.
- Right.

590
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:11,801
- I thoughtyou were leaving.
- I am.

591
00:49:12,935 --> 00:49:15,037
You are so annoying.

592
00:49:15,104 --> 00:49:16,772
- ( Chuckles)
- Wait.

593
00:49:16,839 --> 00:49:21,110
I don't have to leave.
This is my part ofthe ship. You leave.

594
00:49:21,177 --> 00:49:23,579
Oh-ho-ho,
well, well, well.

595
00:49:23,646 --> 00:49:26,149
Now who's being rude?

596
00:49:29,218 --> 00:49:32,321
What is this stupid thing
you're carrying around?

597
00:49:33,422 --> 00:49:35,992
So what areyou,
an artist or something?

598
00:49:37,593 --> 00:49:41,664
Well, these are rather good.

599
00:49:44,901 --> 00:49:48,070
They're, uh--
They're very good actually.

600
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:57,346
Jack, this is exquisite work.

601
00:49:57,413 --> 00:50:00,383
They didn't thinktoo much
ofthem in old Paree.

602
00:50:00,449 --> 00:50:05,888
Paris! You do get around
for a poor--

603
00:50:07,256 --> 00:50:10,259
Well, uh, uh, a person
of limited means.

604
00:50:10,326 --> 00:50:13,496
Go on, a poor guy,
you can say it.

605
00:50:15,665 --> 00:50:18,434
Well, well, well.

606
00:50:21,771 --> 00:50:24,173
And these were drawn from life?

607
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,979
Well, that's one
ofthe good things about Paris--

608
00:50:30,046 --> 00:50:32,915
Iots ofgirls willing
to take their clothes off.

609
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:39,689
You liked this woman.

610
00:50:39,755 --> 00:50:43,426
You used her several times.

611
00:50:43,493 --> 00:50:47,196
Well, she had beautiful hands,
you see?

612
00:50:49,799 --> 00:50:51,767
I thinkyou must have had
a love affairwith her.

613
00:50:51,834 --> 00:50:54,971
No, no, no, no, no.
Just with her hands.

614
00:50:55,037 --> 00:50:57,773
She was a one-legged prostitute.

615
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,309
See?

616
00:51:02,512 --> 00:51:06,082
- ( Aghast): Oh!
- ( Both Chuckle)

617
00:51:06,149 --> 00:51:08,451
Ah, she had a good sense
of humor, though.

618
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:13,656
Oh, and this lady...

619
00:51:13,723 --> 00:51:16,926
she used to sit
at this bar every night

620
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:19,028
wearing every piece
ofjewelry she owned

621
00:51:19,095 --> 00:51:21,197
just waiting
for her long-lost love.

622
00:51:22,331 --> 00:51:24,667
Called her Madame Bijou.

623
00:51:24,734 --> 00:51:28,337
See how her clothes
are all moth-eaten?

624
00:51:28,404 --> 00:51:31,474
Well,you have a gift,Jack.

625
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,744
You do. You see people.

626
00:51:34,811 --> 00:51:37,013
I seeyou.

627
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:40,483
And?

628
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,352
You wouldn't havejumped.

629
00:51:47,623 --> 00:51:51,360
But the purpose of university
is to find a suitable husband.

630
00:51:51,427 --> 00:51:53,529
Rose has already done that.

631
00:51:53,596 --> 00:51:56,165
Look, here comes
that vulgar Brown woman.

632
00:51:56,232 --> 00:52:00,102
Quickly, get up
before she sits with us.

633
00:52:00,169 --> 00:52:03,039
Hello, girls. I was hoping
I'd catch you at tea.

634
00:52:03,105 --> 00:52:05,041
We're awfully sorry
you missed it.

635
00:52:05,107 --> 00:52:08,511
The countess and I werejust off
to take the air on the boat deck.

636
00:52:08,578 --> 00:52:11,581
What a lovely idea.
I need to catch up on my gossip.

637
00:52:15,017 --> 00:52:17,453
Molly:
Countess.

638
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,790
Soyou've notyet
lit the last four boilers?

639
00:52:20,857 --> 00:52:24,494
No, I don't see the need.
We are making excellent time.

640
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,430
The press knows
the size of Titanic.

641
00:52:27,497 --> 00:52:30,399
Now I want them to marvel
at her speed.

642
00:52:30,466 --> 00:52:33,136
We must give them
something new to print.

643
00:52:34,804 --> 00:52:38,774
This maiden voyage of Titanic
must make headlines.

644
00:52:38,841 --> 00:52:43,146
Mr. Ismay, I would prefer
not to push the engines

645
00:52:43,212 --> 00:52:46,516
until they've been
properly run in.

646
00:52:46,582 --> 00:52:48,518
Ofcourse
I'mjust a passenger.

647
00:52:48,584 --> 00:52:51,053
I leave it toyour good offices
to decide what's best.

648
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:54,056
But what a glorious end
toyourfinal crossing

649
00:52:54,123 --> 00:52:57,393
ifwe were to get into New York
on Tuesday night and surprise them all.

650
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:01,531
Make the morning papers.
Retire with a bang, eh, E.J.?

651
00:53:05,434 --> 00:53:07,436
Good man.

652
00:53:07,503 --> 00:53:11,073
Well, afterthat I worked on
a squid boat in Monterey.

653
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:14,076
Then I went down to Los Angeles
to the pier in Santa Monica

654
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:18,114
and started doing portraits there
forten cents apiece.

655
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:22,285
Why can't I be likeyou,Jack--
just head out forthe horizon

656
00:53:22,351 --> 00:53:25,321
whenever I feel like it?

657
00:53:25,388 --> 00:53:28,291
Saywe'll go there
sometime to that pier

658
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:30,526
even ifwe only
everjust talk about it.

659
00:53:30,593 --> 00:53:32,528
No, we'll do it.

660
00:53:32,595 --> 00:53:37,099
We'll drink cheap beer. We'll ride
on the roller coastertill we throw up.

661
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:40,336
Then we'll ride horses on the beach
right in the surf.

662
00:53:40,403 --> 00:53:44,607
Butyou'll have to do it like a real
cowboy. None ofthat sidesaddle stuff.

663
00:53:44,674 --> 00:53:48,744
- You mean, one leg on each side?
- Yeah.

664
00:53:48,811 --> 00:53:52,181
- Can you show me?
- Sure... ifyou like.

665
00:53:53,683 --> 00:53:58,454
- Teach me to ride like a man.
- And chew tobacco like a man.

666
00:53:58,521 --> 00:54:00,890
And spit like a man.

667
00:54:00,957 --> 00:54:02,892
They didn't teach you that
in finishing school?

668
00:54:02,959 --> 00:54:06,429
- No.
- Well, come on, I'll showyou.

- That's disgusting!
- All right,yourturn.

674
00:54:23,246 --> 00:54:25,181
That was pitiful!

675
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:27,617
Come on,you really got
to hawk it back,you know?

01:01:18,661 --> 01:01:20,596
Ismay:
She may be mine on paper

769
01:01:20,663 --> 01:01:23,432
but in the eyes ofGod,
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

770
01:01:23,499 --> 01:01:25,434
( Whispering):
Are these all for me?

771
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:27,703
Just start from the outside
and workyourway in.

772
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:30,006
He knows every rivet
in her, don'tyou, Thomas?

773
01:01:30,072 --> 01:01:33,476
- Your ship is a wonder, truly.
- Thankyou, Rose.

774
01:01:36,345 --> 01:01:39,715
- And how doyou takeyour caviar, sir?
- No caviarfor me, thanks.

775
01:01:39,782 --> 01:01:41,717
Never did like it much.

776
01:01:42,985 --> 01:01:46,222
And where, exactly,
doyou live, Mr. Dawson?

777
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:49,459
Well, right now, my address
is the R.M.S. Titanic.

778
01:01:49,525 --> 01:01:51,928
Afterthat,
I'm on God's good humor.

779
01:01:51,994 --> 01:01:54,330
And how is it
you have means to travel?

780
01:01:54,397 --> 01:01:56,566
I work myway
from place to place--

781
01:01:56,632 --> 01:01:58,868
You know,
tramp steamers and such.

782
01:01:58,935 --> 01:02:01,237
But I won myticket
on Titanic here

783
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:03,473
at a lucky hand at poker.

784
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:06,609
A very lucky hand.

785
01:02:06,676 --> 01:02:09,078
- All life is a game of luck.
- Mmm.

786
01:02:09,145 --> 01:02:11,080
A real man makes
his own luck, Archie.

787
01:02:11,147 --> 01:02:13,649
- Right, Dawson?
- Mmm.

788
01:02:13,716 --> 01:02:18,521
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing, doyou?

789
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:22,358
Well,yes, ma'am, I do.

790
01:02:22,425 --> 01:02:26,162
I mean, got everything I need
right here with me.

791
01:02:26,229 --> 01:02:29,165
Got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

792
01:02:29,232 --> 01:02:33,102
I mean, I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's going to happen

793
01:02:33,169 --> 01:02:37,340
orwho I'm going to meet,
where I'm going to wind up.

794
01:02:37,406 --> 01:02:41,144
Just the other night, I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now here I am

795
01:02:41,210 --> 01:02:44,380
on the grandest ship in the world
having champagne with you fine people.

796
01:02:44,447 --> 01:02:47,049
- ( Laughter)
- I'll take some more ofthat.

797
01:02:47,116 --> 01:02:50,253
I figure life's a gift,
and I don't intend on wasting it.

798
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:54,557
You never know what hand
you're going to get dealt next.

799
01:02:54,624 --> 01:02:58,394
You learn to take life
as it comes atyou. Hereyou go, Cal.

800
01:02:58,461 --> 01:03:01,230
To make each day count.

801
01:03:01,297 --> 01:03:04,400
- Well said,Jack.
- Hear, hear!

802
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:06,936
To making it count.

803
01:03:08,538 --> 01:03:11,641
- All: To making it count.
- Archie: Bravo.

804
01:03:15,311 --> 01:03:18,581
( MollyLaughing)

805
01:03:18,648 --> 01:03:21,284
Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

806
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:23,286
( Laughter)

807
01:03:23,352 --> 01:03:27,824
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating and he lights a fire.

808
01:03:27,890 --> 01:03:30,660
( Laughter)

809
01:03:30,726 --> 01:03:33,529
( Softly): Next it'll be
brandies in the smoking room.

810
01:03:33,596 --> 01:03:37,733
Archie:
Well,join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

811
01:03:37,800 --> 01:03:39,669
( MenAgree)

812
01:03:39,735 --> 01:03:42,004
Now they retreat into a cloud ofsmoke
and congratulate each other

813
01:03:42,071 --> 01:03:44,106
on being masters ofthe universe.

814
01:03:44,173 --> 01:03:46,309
Ladies, thankyou for
the pleasure ofyour company.

815
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,245
Rose, may I escortyou
backto the cabin?

816
01:03:49,312 --> 01:03:52,982
- No, I'll stay here.
- Hereyou go, Molly.

817
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:55,384
Archie:
Joining us, Dawson?

818
01:03:55,451 --> 01:03:57,854
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, doyou?

819
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,722
No, thanks.
I've got to be heading back.

820
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:01,724
- Ah.
- Probably best.

821
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,393
It'll be all business
and politics, that sort ofthing--

822
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:06,729
Wouldn't interestyou.

823
01:04:06,796 --> 01:04:09,432
But Dawson, good ofyou to come.

824
01:04:14,403 --> 01:04:16,339
Jack, mustyou go?

825
01:04:16,405 --> 01:04:18,941
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

826
01:04:22,278 --> 01:04:24,680
Good night, Rose.
