1
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:35,701
'London.
The city of the rich.'

2
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:38,565
'For many, living here
is akin to living in paradise.'

3
00:01:39,126 --> 00:01:42,933
'But like every other city,
there are some parts in the city'

4
00:01:43,221 --> 00:01:45,701
'where only the unfortunate live.'

5
00:01:45,781 --> 00:01:49,858
'My little house in Southall
was literally a jail for me.'

6
00:01:50,275 --> 00:01:52,148
'I'd feel so suffocated over there.'

7
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:55,101
'I wanted to break free
of that prison.'

8
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:57,298
'Little did I know'

9
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:59,538
'that there prisons
of various kinds.'

10
00:01:59,628 --> 00:02:02,343
Sonia, eat a 'paratha'
before you leave.

11
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:05,585
Mom, I'm already late.
I'll eat with Kabir.

12
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:07,615
Dear, don't ever do that.

13
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:10,270
Never go without eating
after you talk about food.

14
00:02:11,036 --> 00:02:12,476
It's inauspicious.

15
00:02:12,793 --> 00:02:15,703
Please. Don't say
these superstitious things.

16
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:18,438
Sonia makes her own luck.
So chill.

17
00:02:18,528 --> 00:02:21,198
Jyoti, you're barking
at the wrong tree.

18
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,660
This girl is hopeless.

19
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:27,501
I'm sorry, dad. But living here
feels so hopeless.

20
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,768
It never feels like
we are living in London.

21
00:02:30,246 --> 00:02:31,841
Bloody Southall.
- Oh really?

22
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:34,428
Why don't you live in Knightsbridge?

23
00:02:35,126 --> 00:02:37,396
We gave you whatever we had.

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,863
She's an ungrateful daughter.

25
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,038
Dad, don't start now.

26
00:02:41,128 --> 00:02:43,576
I'm just saying
I won't spend my life in...

27
00:02:44,391 --> 00:02:47,028
What the hell!
Why am I even explaining it to you?

28
00:02:49,356 --> 00:02:51,628
'I'd pinned all my hopes
to Kabir.'

29
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:55,466
'He had an audition scheduled
with a major music company.'

30
00:02:55,721 --> 00:02:57,570
Hi. Can I have my tulips?

31
00:02:57,823 --> 00:02:59,903
'If Kabir bags this contract'

32
00:03:00,486 --> 00:03:02,435
'everything will be fine.
- Thank you.

33
00:03:02,898 --> 00:03:05,738
'This was the only hope
that kept both of us going.'

34
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,186
Look at that.

35
00:03:08,425 --> 00:03:10,941
What the hell!
How did that happen?

36
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:15,921
They say, when God gives you,
He gives you abundantly.

37
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:20,758
I was practising the whole night

38
00:03:20,985 --> 00:03:23,803
and then I got too tired,
I left the guitar on the couch

39
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,610
and as usual
the roof started leaking.

40
00:03:27,636 --> 00:03:29,648
In the morning, I noticed
the wood had blackened.

41
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,771
Damn! What will we do now?

42
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:34,140
Nothing. We wait.

43
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:36,186
For the next year.

44
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:39,843
Maybe dreams are fulfilled...
- No way, Kabir.

45
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,515
This is not only your dream,
but mine too.

46
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:46,355
We can't get out of here
till you achieve fame.

47
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,266
We'll be trapped in Southall
for good.

48
00:03:48,356 --> 00:03:50,046
Do you think I like it here?

49
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,378
I hate this place more than you do.

50
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,466
But we don't have another option.

51
00:03:58,286 --> 00:03:59,581
Baby, you don't worry.

52
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,831
Focus on your performance.

53
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:03,918
Leave the rest to me.

54
00:04:04,278 --> 00:04:05,268
Okay?

55
00:04:06,216 --> 00:04:08,515
Sonia! Early in the morning!

56
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,603
Either, you've landed in trouble

57
00:04:10,693 --> 00:04:12,741
or you're about to start one.

58
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:15,456
Shut your mouth
or you'll be in trouble.

59
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,205
Fine! Tell me, what's the issue?

60
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:20,680
I have to open the restaurant.
I'm not free.

61
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:23,513
Pabbi, I need 500 pounds urgently.

62
00:04:23,753 --> 00:04:24,688
Please help me.

63
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:25,975
500 quid.

64
00:04:26,065 --> 00:04:28,541
Had I got that kind of money,
would I be working at this joint?

65
00:04:28,745 --> 00:04:30,960
Pabbi, only you can help me now.

66
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,443
I'm desperate.

67
00:04:34,228 --> 00:04:35,586
There is one way.

68
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,768
No, Pabbi, I won't do anything
like that.

69
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:45,453
Gosh! You decent people
and your inhibitions!

70
00:04:46,353 --> 00:04:49,548
You don't want to be desperate,
you don't want to cut corners.

71
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:52,323
Yet you won't hesitate
to take ill-gotten gains.

72
00:04:52,598 --> 00:04:54,831
You want Pabbi to take
all the risk

73
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:56,901
and you just want to enjoy.

74
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,811
Since you call me your friend,
here's my offer.

75
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:03,528
All you have to do is
deliver a package

76
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:05,013
and get paid for it.

77
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,756
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

78
00:05:12,491 --> 00:05:14,293
The walls suffocate you

79
00:05:14,383 --> 00:05:16,240
and you don't even
want to open the door.

80
00:05:17,188 --> 00:05:18,363
Strange!

81
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:29,246
Okay, fine.

82
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,108
But just one time.

83
00:05:31,198 --> 00:05:32,566
Wait, I'll get the packet.

84
00:05:57,048 --> 00:05:58,391
Your package.

85
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:00,350
Come in.

86
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:01,963
No, no

87
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:03,716
I'd rather stay here.

88
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,923
My money?

89
00:06:05,068 --> 00:06:05,848
For f**k's sake,

90
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:07,563
I'm not gonna hand over that
sort of money at the doorstep.

91
00:06:07,796 --> 00:06:09,483
Anyway, I need to inspect
the merchandise.

92
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:12,526
So either come in or
take the f**king package and go.

93
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:16,456
I'll come. - Officer Smith.
- Who is this?

94
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:20,020
You've been asking around
for an Indian drug runner.

95
00:06:20,565 --> 00:06:23,836
Well, I overheard a conversation
at my restaurant.

96
00:06:39,806 --> 00:06:40,840
Eyes on the suspect!

97
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:42,526
Tell uniform that
we have a bit of tangle!

98
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:21,456
'Ladies, follow me.'

99
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,488
'You all have your assignment work
for his week.'

100
00:08:24,655 --> 00:08:26,963
'Make yourself useful
and productive.'

101
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,263
'The only way of getting out
of here early'

102
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:31,213
'is to make yourself productive'

103
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:35,106
'to a society that believes
that you're completely useless.'

104
00:09:03,911 --> 00:09:05,276
Shonda wants to lay.

105
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:14,786
Sonia, you have the t**t.

106
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,900
that is a very little use
over here in the next 14 years.

107
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:22,708
Shonda wants to make you
her first and her best.

108
00:09:23,681 --> 00:09:25,266
You'll be a queen.

109
00:09:25,513 --> 00:09:26,823
What have you got to lose?

110
00:09:30,951 --> 00:09:33,801
Looks like we need to teach
this Indian b***h some prison rules.

111
00:09:52,543 --> 00:09:53,405
B***h!

112
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:20,033
B***h! Get her!

113
00:10:28,871 --> 00:10:31,170
B***h! B***h!

114
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:33,313
Get her! B***h!

115
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,768
Get her off!

116
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:44,336
Get her off! Get her off!

117
00:10:45,628 --> 00:10:47,396
Get her off!

118
00:10:47,716 --> 00:10:49,465
Get her off, you b***h!

119
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,678
All right, just back off!

120
00:11:03,431 --> 00:11:04,933
Someone, call an ambulance.

121
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,426
Relax, you'll be fine.

122
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:33,136
When you came in,
there was blood everywhere.

123
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,498
But the doctors have
done a good job.

124
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:37,633
I'm in no hurry.

125
00:11:38,411 --> 00:11:39,421
I have nowhere to go.

126
00:11:39,511 --> 00:11:41,738
But I have something that
will put you in a better mood.

127
00:11:41,985 --> 00:11:43,460
I've got someone here to see you.

128
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,458
I think you're gonna
want to see him.

129
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:47,546
Better than any medicine.

130
00:12:14,196 --> 00:12:15,603
Red tulips.

131
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:17,663
Thank you.

132
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:19,300
My expert girlfriend says

133
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:21,006
red is for everlasting love.

134
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,568
She is a tulip expert.

135
00:12:24,506 --> 00:12:26,178
Then you should've brought
the yellow one.

136
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:28,886
It suits my situation.

137
00:12:30,503 --> 00:12:32,461
Because yellow is for hopeless love.

138
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:35,363
I haven't given up hopes yet.

139
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:38,071
You shouldn't give up either.

140
00:12:38,376 --> 00:12:39,755
If you abandon hopes,

141
00:12:40,921 --> 00:12:42,223
then you can't fight
the circumstances.

142
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,416
Hopes

143
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:48,050
I'll be spending 14 years
in prison,

144
00:12:48,371 --> 00:12:49,878
how can I have any hopes?

145
00:12:49,968 --> 00:12:52,815
You know we can appeal
for an early release.

146
00:12:53,143 --> 00:12:55,558
I wish I could share
your optimism.

147
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,798
Anyway, forget about it.

148
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,990
Tell me about my family.

149
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,385
Are my parents
still angry with me?

150
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,978
They didn't come to meet me once.

151
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,100
They've forgiven you,

152
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:14,451
but maintaining relations with you
can affect your sisters.

153
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:19,761
They have to get married.

154
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,461
Since their sister is in jail,

155
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,301
that can harm their reputation.

156
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:29,001
They are right.

157
00:13:30,168 --> 00:13:32,971
I didn't think about them.
So why would they think about me?

158
00:13:33,386 --> 00:13:34,976
It was my life.

159
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,396
I lived my life on my own terms.

160
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:39,350
Life has brought me
at this juncture

161
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,210
and I don't blame anyone for it.

162
00:13:42,978 --> 00:13:44,683
No one else is responsible.

163
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:47,891
Not even you.

164
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,598
Why are you waiting for me?

165
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,053
Are you crazy?

166
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:54,111
Kabir, you should leave

167
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:58,238
before my unfortunate life
makes your life bleak.

168
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,788
You're the light of my life, Sonia.

169
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,086
How can you bring darkness?

170
00:14:03,245 --> 00:14:04,973
Don't be stupid.

171
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,771
Will you spend your life in dark
for this light?

172
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,441
My life has been ruined,
but why ruin yours?

173
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,953
Both of us wanted to
break free of Southall.

174
00:14:17,283 --> 00:14:18,766
I couldn't get out,

175
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:20,571
but you still can.

176
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,031
Why do you want to live in
prison like me?

177
00:14:28,558 --> 00:14:30,416
For my sake, Kabir.

178
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:33,845
You won't see me again.

179
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,248
Go away.
- I don't...

180
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,661
Been more than ten minutes, buddy.

181
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:41,431
Your time's up, I'm afraid.

182
00:15:16,386 --> 00:15:18,156
It's a damn operation theatre.

183
00:15:18,308 --> 00:15:19,411
Why am I brought here?

184
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,838
We'll have to close this,

185
00:15:20,928 --> 00:15:23,113
so we thought we'd bring
portable x-ray machine to you.

186
00:15:23,688 --> 00:15:25,388
Don't worry,
doctor will be here soon.

187
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:27,528
Hello. Hello.

188
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:35,206
Shonda sent you here, didn't she?

189
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,211
If she wants to kill me,
she should attack openly.

190
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:40,043
The day we want to kill you,

191
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,373
we'll do so without any permission.

192
00:15:44,638 --> 00:15:46,381
Right now, I am here to save you.

193
00:15:47,891 --> 00:15:49,475
I trade in lives.

194
00:15:50,238 --> 00:15:51,828
My name is Kaya.

195
00:16:01,566 --> 00:16:03,653
Are you a lawyer?

196
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,893
Did Kabir send you?
- Shut up and listen.

197
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:12,675
My company provides a
special service to our rich clients.

198
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:15,431
I trade in secrets.

199
00:16:15,521 --> 00:16:17,248
This is a modern age weapon.

200
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:19,578
These days no one attacks openly.

201
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:24,496
If you want to finish off anyone,
just find out all his secrets.

202
00:16:24,738 --> 00:16:28,841
Persuade, purchase, punish,
secrets. Secrets are very powerful.

203
00:16:29,303 --> 00:16:31,363
We trade in secrets.

204
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:34,051
Traders of secrets.

205
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,043
Governments,
politicians, multinationals.

206
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:40,340
All of them need our services
every now and then.

207
00:16:41,358 --> 00:16:43,571
But secrets aren't easily available.

208
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,528
You have to extract them.

209
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,225
That's what my team does.

210
00:16:48,693 --> 00:16:52,386
We always need girls
who can help us out.

211
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:55,135
Whatever happened to you in jail,

212
00:16:55,611 --> 00:16:57,721
consider it to be an interview.

213
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:01,238
I'm here to tell you,
you are hired.

214
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:05,636
You hired me,

215
00:17:06,523 --> 00:17:08,611
but you didn't tell me
my job profile.

216
00:17:09,116 --> 00:17:12,618
What can women offer in
the world controlled by men

217
00:17:12,816 --> 00:17:14,173
except their bodies?

218
00:17:15,228 --> 00:17:16,503
Prostitution.

219
00:17:16,788 --> 00:17:18,548
It's an age-old business, girl.

220
00:17:19,023 --> 00:17:21,068
We just do it with style.

221
00:17:23,346 --> 00:17:25,333
What if I refuse this offer?

222
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:29,920
If you go back to jail,
you won't live.

223
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,953
Even if you live,

224
00:17:32,043 --> 00:17:34,611
what will be your
life after 14 years?

225
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,543
What I am offering you
is not a job?

226
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:39,870
It's a lifestyle.

227
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:41,328
Think about it.

228
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,683
What do I have to do?

229
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,201
You'll have to die.

230
00:17:45,578 --> 00:17:46,743
What?

231
00:17:48,641 --> 00:17:51,433
Sonia must die??

232
00:17:52,673 --> 00:17:54,593
Friends, families, relatives.

233
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,423
You'll have to severe ties
with everyone.

234
00:17:58,228 --> 00:18:01,241
Even small weakness
in this profession

235
00:18:01,966 --> 00:18:03,328
can prove fatal.

236
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:06,846
No past, no connections,

237
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:08,716
no weaknesses.

238
00:18:09,156 --> 00:18:11,728
You'll be given a new identity,
a new life.

239
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:16,616
But once you enter our world,

240
00:18:17,993 --> 00:18:21,101
you won't be able
to return to your old life.

241
00:18:22,178 --> 00:18:24,333
So think before you say anything.

242
00:18:26,093 --> 00:18:27,830
You have 24 hours.

243
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,783
In case, you decide to join us,

244
00:18:31,516 --> 00:18:33,211
send for Dr Murphy.

245
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:40,515
'From the confines of Southall,
I ended up in jail.'

246
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:42,563
'Now I've been given a chance'

247
00:18:42,761 --> 00:18:45,660
'to get out of jail
and enter Kaya's prison.'

248
00:18:46,001 --> 00:18:49,071
'I looked closely and didn't find
much of a difference in them.'

249
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,045
'But I realised Sonia's death
will give me lots of benefits.'

250
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:57,273
'My parents and sisters won't
need to be ashamed anymore.'

251
00:18:58,211 --> 00:19:00,613
'Kabir will stop waiting for me.'

252
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,501
'He'll be able to begin
his life anew.'

253
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:07,005
'Maybe everyone benefits
if I accept Kaya's offer.'

254
00:19:50,401 --> 00:19:52,715
Yes! The Indian prisoner.
She's escaped.

255
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:55,013
No, I don't know.
Yes, the police. Yes.

256
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:57,113
Okay. Thank you, thank you.

257
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,780
S**t hit the fan.

258
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,076
Chris Toms.
- It's good to see you.

259
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,428
And you, men!
Stand down, stand down.

260
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:53,293
What's happening?

261
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:55,625
It's a big operation.
Come on, we don't have time.

262
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:57,401
I need you to change.

263
00:20:58,403 --> 00:20:59,998
Quickly. We don't have time.

264
00:21:01,733 --> 00:21:02,866
Come on, guys.
Quick, quick, quick.

265
00:21:03,073 --> 00:21:04,423
Come on, do it fast!

266
00:21:12,173 --> 00:21:13,481
Come no, quickly.

267
00:21:31,243 --> 00:21:33,391
It's her, right?

268
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,518
She was trying to escape from jail.

269
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,070
The car was found in a ravine

270
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,346
and then there was an explosion.

271
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,760
We've found two bodies.

272
00:21:45,663 --> 00:21:47,865
That too completely burnt.

273
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,756
Why would she try to escape?

274
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,650
She had no friends.

275
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,673
Who will she run with?

276
00:21:57,823 --> 00:22:00,748
Drugs Mafia often
try to save their people.

277
00:22:00,898 --> 00:22:02,730
This is a big misunderstanding.

278
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:05,268
She had no connection
with any drug Mafia.

279
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:08,678
No one knows her better
than I do.

280
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:14,101
Whatever she did,
she did it for me.

281
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:17,246
What's a betrayal?

282
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:22,221
You're always betrayed by
someone whom you trust.

283
00:22:22,873 --> 00:22:26,828
I'm not saying you
know anything about this, but...

284
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:29,108
surely...

285
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,176
The fact is

286
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,423
that your girlfriend
was caught with drugs.

287
00:22:33,513 --> 00:22:37,758
She tried to escape jail
and she had planned it well.

288
00:22:39,711 --> 00:22:41,433
I still can't believe it.

289
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,015
Till Sonia personally tells me,

290
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:52,091
I can't believe any of it.

291
00:23:12,543 --> 00:23:13,945
Welcome to the facility.

292
00:23:14,456 --> 00:23:16,103
Take a closer look at this place.

293
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:20,131
This place will
turn you into a weapon.

294
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:23,365
A weapon which can destroy anything

295
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:26,311
or any person for that matter.

296
00:23:27,066 --> 00:23:29,306
But before you target others,

297
00:23:29,735 --> 00:23:32,206
you must target yourself.

298
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:35,106
You have to torture yourself
so much

299
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,658
so that no one
tortures yourself.

300
00:23:38,385 --> 00:23:40,413
That's the thing about
broken hearts.

301
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,958
The heart has to break
only once.

302
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,886
You had left this in jail.

303
00:23:52,126 --> 00:23:53,636
Thank you.

304
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,508
Tear it.

305
00:23:58,516 --> 00:23:59,640
What?

306
00:24:00,191 --> 00:24:02,355
Sonia Khanna is in that picture.

307
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,765
You have to kill Sonia Khanna
and be reborn again,

308
00:24:07,596 --> 00:24:10,298
we must perform
her last rites.

309
00:24:10,821 --> 00:24:12,026
Come on.

310
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,973
You must die to be reborn again.

311
00:24:20,366 --> 00:24:21,508
Never mind.

312
00:24:22,881 --> 00:24:24,940
The day you tear this picture,

313
00:24:25,501 --> 00:24:28,321
your life will begin.

314
00:24:29,606 --> 00:24:32,001
Carrying burden of your death

315
00:24:33,128 --> 00:24:34,396
It's not easy.

316
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:55,833
"You're my day
and I am night."

317
00:24:56,970 --> 00:25:03,373
"I don't exist without you."

318
00:25:04,585 --> 00:25:11,011
"Without you, I'm not even earth"

319
00:25:12,023 --> 00:25:18,778
"In you lies my vast sky."

320
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:22,866
"It's an incomplete dream."

321
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:26,483
"Your passion rages in me."

322
00:25:26,803 --> 00:25:33,371
"You're in every breath of mine."

323
00:25:33,735 --> 00:25:37,285
"You're my peace."

324
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:41,076
"You're my intoxication."

325
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:45,926
"How can I forget you?"

326
00:25:46,016 --> 00:25:48,783
"You are my love."

327
00:25:48,873 --> 00:25:52,273
"You're my peace."

328
00:25:52,556 --> 00:25:56,138
"You're my intoxication."

329
00:25:56,228 --> 00:26:00,768
"How can I forget you?"

330
00:26:00,858 --> 00:26:04,523
"You are my love."

331
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,256
Hello, Jim.
- Hello, ma'am.

332
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,793
Go and seduce him.

333
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:13,913
Come on, go ahead.

334
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:15,861
"I'm a body"

335
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:18,640
"and you are my shadow."

336
00:26:18,795 --> 00:26:20,270
It's a simple task.

337
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,681
Take this package all the way down.

338
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:24,198
Don't let anybody stop you.

339
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:34,405
"You live in my memories."

340
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:38,151
"Please live"

341
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:40,711
It's not the dog in the fight,

342
00:26:40,931 --> 00:26:42,730
it's the fight in the dog.

343
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,008
"You're my sympathiser."

344
00:26:46,098 --> 00:26:49,775
"You speak my language."

345
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:56,468
"You're tears in my eyes."

346
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,311
"You're my peace."

347
00:27:00,636 --> 00:27:04,235
"You're my intoxication."

348
00:27:04,453 --> 00:27:08,933
"How can I forget you?"

349
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:11,823
"You are my love."

350
00:27:11,913 --> 00:27:15,131
"You're my peace."

351
00:27:15,403 --> 00:27:19,001
"You're my intoxication."

352
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:23,921
"How can I forget you?"

353
00:27:24,151 --> 00:27:27,413
"You are my love."

354
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,345
To be the best in this business,

355
00:27:29,688 --> 00:27:32,571
you must accept your reality.

356
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:35,576
Repeat after me, Sonia.

357
00:27:35,783 --> 00:27:38,768
My job is to sell my body
in exchange of secrets.

358
00:27:39,406 --> 00:27:41,313
That's it and nothing else.

359
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,856
You can't come to terms
with the truth.

360
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:47,883
How will you be able to
sell your body?

361
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,270
Say it.

362
00:27:51,281 --> 00:27:52,500
Say it.

363
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:53,820
Say it!

364
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,773
"You're my moon"

365
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:03,368
Your so-called death
has given Kabir a new lease of life.

366
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:10,671
"You burn in me."

367
00:28:11,568 --> 00:28:18,158
"May I touch you?"

368
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:25,580
"You are in my heartbeat."

369
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:33,436
"We've separated from each other
like fire from smoke."

370
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:40,253
"You're the grief of my soul."

371
00:28:40,721 --> 00:28:44,230
"You're my peace."

372
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,003
"You're my intoxication."

373
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:52,571
"How can I forget you?"

374
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,568
"You are my love."

375
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:59,263
"You're my peace."

376
00:28:59,553 --> 00:29:03,133
"You're my intoxication."

377
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:07,766
"How can I forget you?"

378
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:11,618
"You are my love."

379
00:29:28,596 --> 00:29:31,791
Something is fishy about
Foston Penitentiary.

380
00:29:32,101 --> 00:29:35,283
In the last eight months,
many female convict disappeared

381
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:37,485
and when they were discovered

382
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:39,713
their bodies were
beyond recognition.

383
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:42,338
Look at her.
Elizabeth Andrews.

384
00:29:43,221 --> 00:29:44,913
She was convicted eight months ago.

385
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,713
She got ten years in prison.

386
00:29:47,198 --> 00:29:48,560
You already have so many cases.

387
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,196
Why worry about this?

388
00:29:50,661 --> 00:29:53,073
Listen. She is Sukhit Yakub.

389
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:55,428
She was serving life imprisonment.

390
00:29:55,845 --> 00:29:59,118
When she was going for her
appeal hearing, she had an accident.

391
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:01,113
Her body was found completely burnt.

392
00:30:01,203 --> 00:30:02,721
Then comes Sonia.

393
00:30:03,116 --> 00:30:05,493
Sonia suffered the same fate.

394
00:30:05,826 --> 00:30:07,823
It's a strange coincidence.

395
00:30:07,913 --> 00:30:09,608
All these cases are similar.

396
00:30:09,785 --> 00:30:13,156
Women have been convicted with
long-term prison sentences

397
00:30:13,403 --> 00:30:15,116
have untimely accidents.

398
00:30:15,286 --> 00:30:16,733
They die in accidents

399
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:18,800
and their bodies
are beyond recognition.

400
00:30:19,073 --> 00:30:20,286
Something is wrong.
I am sure.

401
00:30:20,456 --> 00:30:23,681
Soaib, I am your elder brother,
so here's a piece of advice.

402
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,883
Stop this madness
and focus on your work.

403
00:30:27,271 --> 00:30:29,288
Your suspension is over.

404
00:30:29,493 --> 00:30:31,186
The department still remembers

405
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:35,071
how you were found drunk in
a row house during your duty hours.

406
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:36,716
Focus on your work.

407
00:30:36,806 --> 00:30:39,431
Just do as you are told.

408
00:30:39,868 --> 00:30:42,303
Pick up this and get out of here.

409
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,313
Sonia Khanna.

410
00:30:48,918 --> 00:30:51,028
You're playing hide and seek
with the law.

411
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,080
But you'll be caught one day.

412
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,863
I'll bring you to book.

413
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:00,466
A small gift from our organisation
for your new life.

414
00:31:00,656 --> 00:31:02,673
I often gawked at skyscrapers
from the streets.

415
00:31:04,006 --> 00:31:05,905
Never in my life I imagined,

416
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:09,191
I'd be able to peek down
from a skyscraper.

417
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:12,866
You've just started
scaling heights.

418
00:31:14,431 --> 00:31:16,343
You have a long way to go.

419
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,296
We can talk about this later.

420
00:31:19,045 --> 00:31:22,021
First, let's celebrate
your birthday.

421
00:31:22,778 --> 00:31:24,323
My birthday?
- Here.

422
00:31:24,773 --> 00:31:27,228
You were born in New Castle
in 1995.

423
00:31:27,546 --> 00:31:29,528
Here's your passport, credit card,

424
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:31,158
license.

425
00:31:31,348 --> 00:31:32,356
All the documents.

426
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:34,493
You didn't complete your education.

427
00:31:35,073 --> 00:31:36,265
Right now, you are a model

428
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:39,361
who works with
Virago Model Agency, Manchester.

429
00:31:40,553 --> 00:31:42,450
This is your work agreement

430
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,835
and your bank accounts.

431
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:50,173
Memorise things about your new life.

432
00:31:50,263 --> 00:31:52,220
What's my name?
- Pari.

433
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,330
Henceforth, you are Pari.

434
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:57,595
Thank you for all this.

435
00:31:57,898 --> 00:32:00,953
Before you move in here,
we must get rid of the old tenant.

436
00:32:02,653 --> 00:32:04,975
Does someone else live here?
- She used to live here.

437
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,843
It's her last day today.

438
00:32:14,038 --> 00:32:15,641
Meet Maneka.

439
00:32:16,698 --> 00:32:18,786
Her life was
no different than yours.

440
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:24,973
I got her out of jail and
gave her shot at a luxurious life.

441
00:32:25,996 --> 00:32:29,361
She wasn't happy despite
all the luxuries.

442
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:31,696
She wanted freedom.

443
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:36,091
She joined hands with our enemies
to achieve freedom.

444
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:38,446
There's still time, go back.

445
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:41,091
This freedom is a mirage

446
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:00,238
Listen carefully, buddy.

447
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:02,248
Meet Abu Hamza al-Riyadhi.

448
00:33:02,601 --> 00:33:03,930
He's come here to buy

449
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,713
weapons worth millions
for the Arabian government.

450
00:33:06,228 --> 00:33:08,033
He is a seasoned player.

451
00:33:08,576 --> 00:33:09,621
Official version says,

452
00:33:09,711 --> 00:33:12,021
he's coming here buy
surface-to-air missile technology.

453
00:33:12,218 --> 00:33:15,801
But actually, he's met Andrei Kobrov
from Russia before coming here.

454
00:33:16,218 --> 00:33:18,701
Andrei is the biggest arms dealer
in Russia.

455
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:24,718
'This is a common practice
in our business.'

456
00:33:25,218 --> 00:33:27,236
'A client often gets quotation
from two vendors'

457
00:33:27,503 --> 00:33:30,981
'and then decides which deal
suits him better.'

458
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:36,391
'We don't want to lose this deal.'

459
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:38,198
'So it's important that'

460
00:33:38,288 --> 00:33:40,306
'our deal should be
better than the Russian dealer.'

461
00:33:40,663 --> 00:33:41,771
'One more thing.'

462
00:33:41,861 --> 00:33:44,098
'He'll be accompanied by
Faisal Baghdadi.'

463
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:45,510
'Be wary of him.'

464
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:48,508
'He is very sharp
and can be dangerous.'

465
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,928
'Abu Hamza will fly to Glasgow
for two days in a private jet.'

466
00:33:52,176 --> 00:33:53,021
Praise be to Allah.

467
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:55,766
'The regular air hostess
will fall ill suddenly'

468
00:33:55,856 --> 00:33:58,036
'and you are her replacement.'

469
00:33:58,318 --> 00:34:02,401
'We have to secure the Russian deal
before tomorrow's arms deal.'

470
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:06,528
'But you don't need to
worry about Hamza.'

471
00:34:07,001 --> 00:34:09,153
'Indian women are his weakness.'

472
00:34:09,653 --> 00:34:11,183
'He'll come to you willingly.'

473
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:14,746
Pari.

474
00:34:15,366 --> 00:34:17,186
Mr Hamza is expecting you.

475
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,208
Hi.

476
00:34:23,668 --> 00:34:25,983
I'd like to think
it is my charm

477
00:34:26,073 --> 00:34:28,268
not the money
that brought you here.

478
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:30,828
I saw the money.

479
00:34:31,138 --> 00:34:32,513
I'm yet to see the charm.

480
00:34:34,786 --> 00:34:36,951
I like a woman
with a sense of humour.

481
00:34:37,423 --> 00:34:39,088
We are going to enjoy this.

482
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,481
There's a packet
in the guest bedroom.

483
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,395
You'll know how to use it.
Please.

484
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:07,181
There's no greater joy than
seeing a pretty girl in your power.

485
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,733
I like to hear painful screams
of a woman more than

486
00:35:26,095 --> 00:35:28,336
Please! No, no!

487
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,408
Ladies and gentlemen, there seems
to be a false alarm.

488
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,178
As you can see none of
the sprinklers have been set off.

489
00:39:25,343 --> 00:39:28,293
And so there is no real
danger of fire.

490
00:39:28,468 --> 00:39:30,896
We're very, very sorry about this.

491
00:39:30,986 --> 00:39:33,165
If you'd please return
to your rooms,

492
00:39:33,853 --> 00:39:35,653
try and get some sleep.

493
00:40:15,203 --> 00:40:17,466
The wounds aren't deep or else

494
00:40:17,918 --> 00:40:19,231
you'd need stitches.

495
00:40:20,288 --> 00:40:22,538
And plastic surgery to hide
those stitches.

496
00:40:23,263 --> 00:40:24,998
If you know what I mean.
- I know.

497
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,638
I wish I knew he'd turn out
to be such a brute.

498
00:40:28,728 --> 00:40:30,268
These lines are so apt.

499
00:40:31,256 --> 00:40:32,476
"These days"

500
00:40:33,451 --> 00:40:35,856
"the truth is a dream."

501
00:40:36,788 --> 00:40:38,763
"You can't recognise anyone."

502
00:40:39,363 --> 00:40:40,690
"For there's a mask over
every face."

503
00:40:42,213 --> 00:40:44,618
I've realised one truth
amid this life of deceit.

504
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:48,158
Sex is never just sex.

505
00:40:49,096 --> 00:40:50,351
It is a deal.

506
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,616
I have high hopes from you, Pari.

507
00:40:54,145 --> 00:40:56,240
You'll make a quick progress.

508
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:59,450
I'm glad that my training
helped you.

509
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,406
The management will be
very happy with you.

510
00:41:03,786 --> 00:41:06,383
Or else Mr Black doesn't
invite anyone to meet him.

511
00:41:06,686 --> 00:41:07,900
Who is Mr Black?

512
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,748
This company is owned by Mr Black.

513
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:11,568
All of us work for him.

514
00:41:11,716 --> 00:41:14,318
But no one knows
who is Mr Black.

515
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:16,695
No one has seen him so far.

516
00:41:17,296 --> 00:41:19,440
He issues orders
and we follow them.

517
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,048
You haven't seen him either.

518
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,931
Yes, I have not.

519
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,921
Mr Black knows about everything.

520
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:28,453
So we don't need to
tell him anything.

521
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,726
If he wants to say anything,

522
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:32,891
he sends us a message
through his lawyer.

523
00:41:33,928 --> 00:41:35,648
We're going to the same lawyer
right now.

524
00:41:35,738 --> 00:41:36,968
Rutherford.

525
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:40,318
Mr Black interacts
with only Rutherford.

526
00:41:41,258 --> 00:41:43,833
All of us follow
Rutherford's instruction.

527
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,986
You'll hear many stories
about Mr Black.

528
00:41:47,275 --> 00:41:50,561
You'll have to decide which ones
are true and which are fiction.

529
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:53,348
We steal secrets for him,

530
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:55,146
but he himself is
the biggest secret.

531
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,778
Something like that.

532
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,388
Thank you so much for coming, Kaya.

533
00:42:00,656 --> 00:42:02,533
And hi.
- You're welcome.

534
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,906
Is there anything in particular
Mr Black wanted to talk about?

535
00:42:07,076 --> 00:42:08,663
Oh, no.
Nothing like that really.

536
00:42:08,975 --> 00:42:12,325
Just that he was, he was
really happy with the Abu Hamza job.

537
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:13,713
He wanted to thank you

538
00:42:13,803 --> 00:42:15,138
and see the girl who did it.

539
00:42:16,366 --> 00:42:18,991
You mean he can see me right now.

540
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:20,621
Yes, he can.

541
00:42:22,376 --> 00:42:25,148
Mr Black is also very sorry

542
00:42:25,445 --> 00:42:27,378
for the way you were treated
by Abu Hamza.

543
00:42:27,935 --> 00:42:29,455
And he is very appreciative

544
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:32,286
as you still managed
to get the information for us.

545
00:42:33,006 --> 00:42:35,298
He wants to thank you

546
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:37,633
with this.

547
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:40,081
Should you accept it

548
00:42:45,910 --> 00:42:48,533
Mr Black believes that brave act
must be rewarded.

549
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:53,978
I'm sure, you agree, Ms Kaya.

550
00:42:55,226 --> 00:42:57,626
Oh, yes. Yes, I do.
Absolutely.

551
00:42:58,295 --> 00:43:00,595
I think Pari is
going to be our best.

552
00:43:01,413 --> 00:43:02,661
The best we've ever had.

553
00:43:38,455 --> 00:43:41,788
"This night is full
of intoxication."

554
00:43:41,973 --> 00:43:44,821
"As you are not with me."

555
00:43:45,041 --> 00:43:48,190
"Had you been with me"

556
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,280
"Had I seen you"

557
00:43:54,801 --> 00:43:57,835
"I would've looked at you closely."

558
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,318
"I would've loved you closely."

559
00:44:01,408 --> 00:44:04,801
"I would've gazed at you
to my heart's content."

560
00:44:04,891 --> 00:44:09,086
"I would've asked you
from my destiny."

561
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:14,433
"I would've thought about it
in your presence."

562
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:17,728
"I would've taken a plunge."

563
00:44:17,928 --> 00:44:21,138
"I would've taken you
into my arms."

564
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:25,760
"I would've asked you
from my destiny."

565
00:44:54,333 --> 00:44:59,341
"You were like a wave."

566
00:45:00,171 --> 00:45:05,735
"I would flow with you"

567
00:45:07,685 --> 00:45:12,763
"You were akin to a town."

568
00:45:13,213 --> 00:45:19,173
"I'd live in you."

569
00:45:20,803 --> 00:45:24,013
"Without you, I have to city
and no home."

570
00:45:24,103 --> 00:45:27,380
"Without you, my life
has come to a standstill."

571
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:31,983
"Without you, I don't know anything,
I don't exist."

572
00:45:32,281 --> 00:45:36,215
"Yes, I am. Yes, I am!"

573
00:45:36,823 --> 00:45:39,901
"I would've gazed at you
to my heart's content."

574
00:45:40,208 --> 00:45:42,333
"I would've loved you closely."

575
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:43,318
Let's leave.

576
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:46,653
"I would've taken you
into my arms."

577
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:52,111
"I would've asked you
from my destiny."

578
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,268
Sonia! Sonia, stop!
- Please step back.

579
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:19,791
Sir, please.
- I know her! Sonia.

580
00:46:20,136 --> 00:46:21,711
Sonia, what the hell is going on?

581
00:46:21,801 --> 00:46:22,885
Who are these people?

582
00:46:23,161 --> 00:46:24,466
Get back.
- Just shut up.

583
00:46:25,081 --> 00:46:26,051
Do you know this man, Pari?

584
00:46:26,193 --> 00:46:28,021
Pari? She is not Pari,
she is Sonia.

585
00:46:28,293 --> 00:46:30,983
I have no idea who he is
and what he is talking about.

586
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:33,480
Sonia!
- Come on, sir...

587
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,398
You can fool the world, but not me.

588
00:46:35,601 --> 00:46:37,463
Why are you doing this to me, Sonia?
Sonia!

589
00:46:37,651 --> 00:46:38,616
Sonia, listen to me.

590
00:46:38,818 --> 00:46:43,593
"My days are angry with me."

591
00:46:43,970 --> 00:46:50,406
"And so are my nights
Without you"

592
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:57,106
"I feel restless."

593
00:46:57,196 --> 00:47:02,960
"My heart sinks without you."

594
00:47:04,843 --> 00:47:08,098
"Without you, I battle loneliness
and I live in infamy."

595
00:47:08,265 --> 00:47:11,430
"Without you, I hear strange murmurs
and silence haunts me."

596
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:15,803
"Without you, desolation looms
and sadness rules my heart."

597
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:20,803
"Yes, there is. Yes, there is!"

598
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:24,401
"I would've gazed at you
to my heart's content."

599
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:26,473
"I would've loved you closely."

600
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:29,030
The first cruise at the Thames
departs at 10 am.

601
00:47:29,216 --> 00:47:30,741
I'll wait for you there.

602
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:36,253
"I would've asked
you from my destiny."

603
00:47:37,515 --> 00:47:40,380
"I would've thought about it
in your presence."

604
00:47:40,821 --> 00:47:43,951
"I would've taken a plunge."

605
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:47,145
"I would've taken you
into my arms."

606
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:52,180
"I would've asked you
from my destiny."

607
00:47:56,571 --> 00:47:59,383
I'm not that Sonia anymore
whom you once loved.

608
00:47:59,568 --> 00:48:01,931
I work for a shadow organisation

609
00:48:02,135 --> 00:48:03,660
which is so powerful

610
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:06,146
that it can change
governments overnight.

611
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:08,325
They offered me a deal.

612
00:48:08,756 --> 00:48:10,485
They'll help me escape prison

613
00:48:10,873 --> 00:48:12,495
and I'll work for them.

614
00:48:13,845 --> 00:48:16,393
They ask me to meet many men

615
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:18,880
and I oblige.

616
00:48:19,268 --> 00:48:20,846
Did you run away from jail
for this life?

617
00:48:21,118 --> 00:48:23,086
Sonia was already dead
in everyone's eyes.

618
00:48:23,773 --> 00:48:26,260
The sooner you realise this,
the better it is for you.

619
00:48:26,463 --> 00:48:28,173
You don't fall in love
thinking about consequences.

620
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:31,348
If you love me so much
then please listen to me.

621
00:48:32,228 --> 00:48:34,513
My life now belongs to them.

622
00:48:35,210 --> 00:48:37,333
I can't even breathe
without their permission.

623
00:48:37,423 --> 00:48:39,386
You're their slave, not me.

624
00:48:39,986 --> 00:48:42,333
I haven't sold my feelings.

625
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:45,876
You do what you think is right.

626
00:48:47,576 --> 00:48:49,446
I've dedicated my life
to loving you.

627
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:52,083
As long as I live,

628
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:54,608
I won't stop loving you.

629
00:48:54,883 --> 00:48:58,671
These people help the notorious
criminals assume new identities.

630
00:48:59,285 --> 00:49:01,775
But they can just easily
blow your cover.

631
00:49:02,326 --> 00:49:04,950
They won't take much time
to get rid of you.

632
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,193
Even if they erase my life,

633
00:49:07,948 --> 00:49:09,231
I won't let anyone slander my love.

634
00:49:18,993 --> 00:49:20,778
Bonne série!
- Hi, James.

635
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:23,141
There is a package for you.
Hand-delivered.

636
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,861
Hand-delivered package?

637
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,690
Yes. It came a couple
of minutes ago.

638
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:52,113
Hello, Pari.
- You?

639
00:49:52,296 --> 00:49:54,278
The pictures you're
holding right now

640
00:49:55,236 --> 00:49:56,816
are from your morning walk.

641
00:49:57,353 --> 00:49:58,411
You are very lucky,

642
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:02,271
I got them before Kaya did.

643
00:50:02,361 --> 00:50:03,886
But how?

644
00:50:04,148 --> 00:50:06,263
Don't think about how and why.

645
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:09,776
Think hard as you're
running out of time.

646
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:13,718
If you got these pictures
before Kaya did,

647
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:15,588
then why am I running out of time?

648
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:20,906
Whatever mails or reports Kaya
receive are put into an envelope

649
00:50:21,723 --> 00:50:22,965
and the envelope bears a number.

650
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:26,140
A duplicate copy is
sent for archival.

651
00:50:26,653 --> 00:50:28,876
Whenever an envelope
or a number is missing,

652
00:50:29,031 --> 00:50:31,556
Kaya understands that
something is wrong

653
00:50:31,916 --> 00:50:34,406
and she accesses the duplicate
copy immediately.

654
00:50:35,111 --> 00:50:36,608
An hour.

655
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:39,288
You have an hour.
Later...

656
00:50:39,605 --> 00:50:41,093
Kaya will get this.

657
00:50:41,326 --> 00:50:44,161
You know what she is going to do?

658
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,921
I will also suffer Maneka's fate.

659
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:49,163
She'll kill me.
- No.

660
00:50:50,441 --> 00:50:51,696
She'll kill your boyfriend.

661
00:50:56,893 --> 00:50:59,341
Hello. - We don't have must time,
so please listen carefully.

662
00:50:59,575 --> 00:51:01,451
Sonia.
- 'Just do as you are told.'

663
00:51:01,606 --> 00:51:04,328
Get some cash, some clothes
and sneak out through the back-door.

664
00:51:04,418 --> 00:51:07,200
Don't let the CCTV cameras
in the front shop see you.

665
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,140
What's going on?

666
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,348
Cover your face
as much as you can.

667
00:51:10,438 --> 00:51:11,855
So wear a hoodie and your glasses.

668
00:51:12,108 --> 00:51:14,528
Don't meet anyone no matter what.

669
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:16,791
Head straight to the tube station
from your place

670
00:51:17,031 --> 00:51:18,393
and then meet me at King's Cross.

671
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:20,248
I'll pick you up
in an silver Audi.

672
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:22,266
We only have 35 minutes.

673
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,648
Quick! Get in!

674
00:51:50,318 --> 00:51:52,491
And this was today morning?
- Yes.

675
00:51:53,696 --> 00:51:55,946
You know where
this boy stays, Kristov, I assume.

676
00:51:56,173 --> 00:51:58,423
Yes, I do.
- Good.

677
00:51:59,488 --> 00:52:00,983
This boy cannot remain alive.

678
00:52:01,351 --> 00:52:04,045
No one should know
what we do and how we do it.

679
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:06,026
Put him away

680
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,826
and do it in a way
that Pari never finds out.

681
00:52:09,143 --> 00:52:11,775
I'm sorry, ma'am, but
it's a little bit late for that.

682
00:52:11,865 --> 00:52:14,081
What do you mean?
- If you'll allow me.

683
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,423
What the f*** is she doing?

684
00:52:24,698 --> 00:52:26,081
You know what she is doing.

685
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:28,458
Someone has warned her.

686
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,223
She is probably on her way
to one of the many airports already.

687
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,028
Trying to save her boyfriend.

688
00:52:33,691 --> 00:52:35,518
You'll get them, won't you, Kristov?

689
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:38,750
Both of them.
- Yes, ma'am.

690
00:52:44,356 --> 00:52:46,761
Where are we going?
- Do you trust me?

691
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:53,491
Yes, I do. - Please understand
whatever I've learned from them,

692
00:52:54,428 --> 00:52:55,995
I'm using it now

693
00:52:56,565 --> 00:52:58,590
so that both of us
can get out of London.

694
00:52:58,745 --> 00:53:01,446
Both of us, right?
Because I'm not leaving alone.

695
00:53:01,671 --> 00:53:03,068
Yes.

696
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,953
For me, there is no way out now.

697
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:10,488
I betrayed them by saving you

698
00:53:11,363 --> 00:53:13,118
and death is
the only punishment for that.

699
00:53:17,223 --> 00:53:20,285
What happened?
Do you think it's a joke?

700
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:24,666
I'm just thinking about
the strange games that fate plays.

701
00:53:26,456 --> 00:53:28,811
There was time when
we wanted to break free of Southall.

702
00:53:29,271 --> 00:53:30,548
Today, we're running away,

703
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:33,806
but it's not the way
we wanted to it be.

704
00:53:35,781 --> 00:53:37,601
At least, we are together.

705
00:53:38,651 --> 00:53:39,633
This is more than enough.

706
00:53:39,823 --> 00:53:45,600
"Open the door to our dreams."

707
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:51,746
"Let rain of kindness fall on me."

708
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:58,126
"Let me meet again with myself,
let my heart beat again."

709
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:04,236
"Let me burn with passion,
inflame the love flame again."

710
00:54:04,431 --> 00:54:09,555
"Once again a bit"

711
00:54:10,216 --> 00:54:13,321
"Heal my wound again."

712
00:54:13,411 --> 00:54:16,283
"Take away my pain again."

713
00:54:16,373 --> 00:54:21,511
"Let there be love
in the air again."

714
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,126
"Heal my wound again."

715
00:54:25,321 --> 00:54:28,036
"Take away my pain again."

716
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:34,340
"Let your love soothe me again."

717
00:54:37,795 --> 00:54:38,606
Any information?

718
00:54:38,696 --> 00:54:41,498
Pari and the artist have hired
a silver Audi.

719
00:54:41,831 --> 00:54:45,596
License plate number is
LO 17 DQ7. - I see.

720
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:47,581
Right now, the car is parked

721
00:54:47,671 --> 00:54:49,408
outside a small hotel
in village Helford.

722
00:54:49,651 --> 00:54:51,423
You have to handle the rest.

723
00:54:51,793 --> 00:54:54,191
So Javed is
a part of this conspiracy.

724
00:54:58,178 --> 00:55:01,291
Kristov, there is an address
I need you to check out.

725
00:55:08,183 --> 00:55:13,376
"I want to start my life again"

726
00:55:14,148 --> 00:55:18,956
"from the moment we went
separate ways."

727
00:55:20,321 --> 00:55:30,790
"Our love story has been
unfulfilled for ages."

728
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:37,491
"Our future dreams
are flowing as tears"

729
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,151
"They'll take us
to our destination."

730
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:47,041
"Heal my wound again."

731
00:55:47,131 --> 00:55:50,030
"Take away my pain again."

732
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:55,233
"Let there be love
in the air again."

733
00:55:55,911 --> 00:55:59,016
"Heal my wound again."

734
00:55:59,315 --> 00:56:02,083
"Take away my pain again."

735
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:08,643
"Let your love soothe me again."

736
00:56:15,228 --> 00:56:17,283
'I wanted Verna to meet you.'

737
00:56:18,218 --> 00:56:19,733
I wanted to show her

738
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:22,386
that we take such
a good care of our girls.

739
00:56:22,476 --> 00:56:24,531
These tulips are very beautiful.

740
00:56:25,316 --> 00:56:26,938
Where did you get them from?

741
00:56:27,741 --> 00:56:30,795
I know a florist
who arranges them for me.

742
00:56:31,391 --> 00:56:33,396
You also have books on them.

743
00:56:34,298 --> 00:56:36,155
I think you love tulips.

744
00:56:37,476 --> 00:56:38,785
Yes.

745
00:56:40,516 --> 00:56:41,876
Tulips.

746
00:56:43,475 --> 00:56:45,461
Tulips! That's where she has gone.

747
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:47,070
What do you mean?

748
00:56:47,415 --> 00:56:49,458
When someone wants to
fulfil her dreams,

749
00:56:49,548 --> 00:56:52,448
she goes where her dreams are.

750
00:56:52,781 --> 00:56:54,216
And that's where she is.

751
00:56:54,306 --> 00:56:55,433
What do you mean?

752
00:56:55,631 --> 00:56:57,646
I don't understand.
Where did you say she's gone?

753
00:56:58,101 --> 00:56:59,411
Holland.

754
00:56:59,608 --> 00:57:00,788
That's where she is.

755
00:57:02,058 --> 00:57:03,893
But Pari isn't a fool

756
00:57:03,983 --> 00:57:07,363
who will go to an airport
with a fake passport.

757
00:57:07,998 --> 00:57:10,290
She'll use the passport
outside the airport.

758
00:57:10,465 --> 00:57:12,496
That is why a ferry terminal.

759
00:57:12,733 --> 00:57:15,378
As she wants to go away
as far as possible

760
00:57:18,341 --> 00:57:21,296
Kristov, you should take your men
and go to Harwich.

761
00:57:21,511 --> 00:57:22,798
I can bet my life,

762
00:57:22,968 --> 00:57:25,038
Pari is riding the ferry
to Hoek van Holland.

763
00:57:25,846 --> 00:57:27,041
Yes, ma'am.

764
00:57:28,631 --> 00:57:31,223
'Passengers travelling from
custom and immigration'

765
00:57:31,313 --> 00:57:34,161
'are requested to approach Gate 5C
for boarding.'

766
00:57:34,455 --> 00:57:36,853
'Passengers travelling from
custom and immigration'

767
00:57:37,028 --> 00:57:39,946
'are requested to approach Gate 5C
for boarding.'

768
00:57:40,481 --> 00:57:43,180
'Passengers travelling from
custom and immigration'

769
00:57:43,321 --> 00:57:45,623
'are requested to approach Gate 5C
for boarding.'

770
00:57:45,906 --> 00:57:48,073
Go. 'Passengers, may I have
your kind attention.'

771
00:57:53,278 --> 00:57:54,560
'Passengers, may I have
your kind attention.'

772
00:57:55,061 --> 00:57:56,253
Bloody hell.

773
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:58,008
They are here.

774
00:57:58,285 --> 00:57:59,408
Where?

775
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,556
Kristov is in the immigration booth.

776
00:58:02,856 --> 00:58:04,058
Don't react at all.

777
00:58:04,491 --> 00:58:06,253
Keep in line and act normal.

778
00:58:11,535 --> 00:58:12,453
Now?

779
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:15,253
Let me think.

780
00:58:26,263 --> 00:58:28,163
We've been surrounded.

781
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:33,091
Let's try to go some other day.
Let's leave now.

782
00:58:37,888 --> 00:58:39,203
Listen to me carefully.

783
00:58:39,981 --> 00:58:41,850
There will be a bedlam
after 30 seconds.

784
00:58:42,983 --> 00:58:45,043
Cross the immigration
and wait for me there.

785
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:48,353
I'm not leaving you.

786
00:58:49,495 --> 00:58:50,951
Kabir, you've not been
trained at this.

787
00:58:51,041 --> 00:58:52,565
I don't care,
I'm not leaving you.

788
00:58:52,801 --> 00:58:54,578
We'll make it alive
only if you listen to me.

789
00:58:54,888 --> 00:58:56,378
Or else both of us will die.

790
00:59:08,841 --> 00:59:09,738
Fine.

791
01:00:05,488 --> 01:00:07,086
She is here!

792
01:00:26,451 --> 01:00:27,595
Hello, Pari.

793
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:46,366
Drop the gun.

794
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:51,423
Drag her to the facility.

795
01:02:51,018 --> 01:02:54,325
If you think
we are torturing you

796
01:02:54,415 --> 01:02:56,035
then you are wrong.

797
01:02:56,248 --> 01:02:58,558
You've brought this on yourself.

798
01:02:58,838 --> 01:03:00,081
But all this can stop.

799
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:02,048
You just have to tell us

800
01:03:02,268 --> 01:03:04,921
where your boyfriend is
right now

801
01:03:05,503 --> 01:03:08,861
and what you have told him
about our organisation.

802
01:03:12,045 --> 01:03:14,073
F*** you.

803
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:16,120
F*** you.

804
01:03:22,478 --> 01:03:24,348
F*** you, Kaya.

805
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:41,973
Where is your boyfriend?

806
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:46,383
What have you told him
about our organisation?

807
01:03:46,858 --> 01:03:48,420
He knows nothing.

808
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:49,970
He knows nothing about you.

809
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:51,803
Don't involve him, Kaya.

810
01:03:53,143 --> 01:03:55,136
You involved him in this.

811
01:03:55,763 --> 01:03:56,996
We didn't do that.

812
01:03:57,358 --> 01:03:59,096
You met him

813
01:03:59,598 --> 01:04:01,803
and then tried to run away
with him.

814
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:04,660
It's all your fault.

815
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:07,456
Yes, it's my fault.

816
01:04:07,986 --> 01:04:09,873
Then kill me.

817
01:04:10,268 --> 01:04:12,746
But you won't get Kabir's address.

818
01:04:21,533 --> 01:04:23,508
Next time when I ask you,

819
01:04:23,733 --> 01:04:25,933
you won't be alive to say anything.

820
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:28,410
Where is Kabir?

821
01:05:11,295 --> 01:05:12,338
You are lucky.

822
01:05:12,833 --> 01:05:14,215
Your torture will end

823
01:05:14,420 --> 01:05:16,910
because we don't answers
from you anymore.

824
01:05:17,318 --> 01:05:19,245
I'd advise you

825
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,981
to reflect on what you have done.

826
01:05:35,883 --> 01:05:38,311
Look, what you've done.

827
01:05:39,086 --> 01:05:40,998
You killed your boyfriend.

828
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,881
You know where our super efficient
cop Javed found him?

829
01:05:59,646 --> 01:06:01,888
Keukenhof,
a small village in Holland.

830
01:06:02,998 --> 01:06:06,283
He was trying to buy a
house in front of the tulips fields.

831
01:06:07,658 --> 01:06:10,311
He was killed by the girl
who showed him the tulips dreams.

832
01:06:12,336 --> 01:06:16,570
If I had my way, I would've
killed you along with him.

833
01:06:17,963 --> 01:06:21,383
But Mr Black thinks
we can still use your services.

834
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:24,436
Only he knows
what use you'll be to us.

835
01:06:28,553 --> 01:06:32,716
"I'm alive in your eyes."

836
01:06:33,496 --> 01:06:37,836
"I'm the complaint on your lips."

837
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:43,021
"I'm in your life."

838
01:06:43,203 --> 01:06:47,508
"I'll be there when I'm gone."

839
01:06:47,995 --> 01:06:52,238
"Whether you see me or not,"

840
01:06:52,918 --> 01:06:56,676
"I'm always with you."

841
01:06:56,766 --> 01:06:57,726
Kabir.

842
01:06:57,816 --> 01:07:02,101
"Please hide me in your heartbeat."

843
01:07:02,626 --> 01:07:04,595
Kabir!
- "I am"

844
01:07:04,746 --> 01:07:06,830
"Your feeling"

845
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:11,676
"I'll go wherever you go."

846
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:16,581
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

847
01:07:16,813 --> 01:07:21,480
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

848
01:07:21,655 --> 01:07:26,310
"Oh my secret keeper!"

849
01:07:26,508 --> 01:07:30,926
"I'll go wherever you go."

850
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:36,168
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

851
01:07:36,258 --> 01:07:41,010
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

852
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:45,428
"Oh my secret keeper!"

853
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:48,143
I knew Kaya would resort to this.

854
01:07:48,713 --> 01:07:52,471
You're lucky
that Mr Black stopped her on time.

855
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:56,156
Or else, you were going
to die for sure.

856
01:07:59,181 --> 01:08:04,375
Kaya can't go against Mr Black.

857
01:08:06,231 --> 01:08:07,308
Don't they say

858
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:10,345
Clouds that rain,
don't bring thunder.

859
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:13,025
But one thing is sure.

860
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,106
Kaya won't let you live in peace.

861
01:08:24,725 --> 01:08:28,066
I've been working in this
organisation for so many years now.

862
01:08:28,780 --> 01:08:33,885
I've seen many Sonias
becoming Pari.

863
01:08:35,163 --> 01:08:37,146
And then Pari becoming Kaya.

864
01:08:39,298 --> 01:08:42,358
I've seen many girls getting ruined.

865
01:08:43,696 --> 01:08:47,161
They are as dangerous

866
01:08:47,656 --> 01:08:49,420
as they are benevolent.

867
01:08:50,706 --> 01:08:52,656
You have challenged them.

868
01:08:53,810 --> 01:08:55,581
You have called them for a fight.

869
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:59,603
I always mind my business, but...

870
01:09:00,758 --> 01:09:03,068
I can't bear to see you
in this state.

871
01:09:05,283 --> 01:09:06,755
You are different than others, Pari.

872
01:09:07,593 --> 01:09:10,061
So you know what? Screw it.

873
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,483
You don't deserve to die.

874
01:09:15,316 --> 01:09:16,613
You don't.

875
01:09:17,741 --> 01:09:21,356
I can't do much for you,

876
01:09:22,186 --> 01:09:25,193
but I can help you get away.

877
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:30,765
There's a two-mile long tunnel
beneath the house.

878
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,018
Use it.

879
01:09:35,085 --> 01:09:36,636
Run away, Pari.

880
01:09:37,906 --> 01:09:43,250
I don't know how you'll face
Mr Black and Kaya after you get out.

881
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:47,013
But for your pain,

882
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:50,471
I have these painkillers.

883
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:57,611
Your body can't take all that pain

884
01:09:58,078 --> 01:10:00,125
without these pain killers.

885
01:10:00,741 --> 01:10:04,003
My advice.
Take the painkillers, Pari.

886
01:10:53,506 --> 01:10:55,313
Hi, Pari. Anything you want?

887
01:10:55,475 --> 01:10:57,098
I've got instructions
not to let you out of this room.

888
01:10:57,188 --> 01:10:59,128
I need some water
for the medicines.

889
01:10:59,531 --> 01:11:00,786
Perhaps you could help me.

890
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:02,246
Sure.

891
01:12:02,286 --> 01:12:03,316
What's going on?

892
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:06,551
It's Pari.
She's making a run for it.

893
01:12:06,641 --> 01:12:08,583
Shut all the exits down.
- Yes, ma'am.

894
01:12:08,773 --> 01:12:10,488
Pari is trying to make a dash?
- Yes.

895
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:21,331
What the hell is going on?

896
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:46,226
That f****ing woman!

897
01:13:22,045 --> 01:13:23,498
Kaya, you made a mistake.

898
01:13:23,836 --> 01:13:27,138
You should've killed me
along with Kabir.

899
01:13:27,651 --> 01:13:31,763
Because I want to kill you
as long as I am alive.

900
01:13:32,088 --> 01:13:33,993
You're making a mistake here.

901
01:13:35,030 --> 01:13:37,326
Long shadows can
fool you into believing

902
01:13:37,416 --> 01:13:39,933
that you're larger than life.

903
01:13:40,186 --> 01:13:44,128
But you forget that long shadows
are created by the setting sun.

904
01:13:44,405 --> 01:13:45,745
The only difference:

905
01:13:46,716 --> 01:13:49,361
I know the sun has set for me.

906
01:13:51,131 --> 01:13:53,565
I'm not afraid of the dark anymore.

907
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:57,388
I realised
why I couldn't save Kabir.

908
01:13:57,741 --> 01:14:00,823
Because I never got
the training to save anyone.

909
01:14:02,001 --> 01:14:05,408
But I know how to kill.

910
01:14:11,891 --> 01:14:13,633
This gun wasn't loaded.

911
01:14:13,951 --> 01:14:15,390
Think about it.

912
01:14:15,538 --> 01:14:19,268
An unloaded gun made you feel
you were about to die.

913
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:22,028
Just imagine how you'll feel

914
01:14:23,135 --> 01:14:24,728
when I have a loaded gun.

915
01:14:26,351 --> 01:14:28,446
Pari has grown wings.

916
01:14:29,793 --> 01:14:32,008
Now I'll soar in the sky.

917
01:14:33,575 --> 01:14:36,361
Then I'll rain all that thunder

918
01:14:37,496 --> 01:14:39,415
on you from above.

919
01:15:25,686 --> 01:15:27,465
'Life can be so strange.'

920
01:15:28,706 --> 01:15:31,048
'I was confined
when my beloved was alive.'

921
01:15:32,043 --> 01:15:34,561
'Now that I am free,
my beloved is no more.'

922
01:15:36,591 --> 01:15:38,990
'Now I had only one goal.'

923
01:15:40,478 --> 01:15:41,558
'Revenge.'

924
01:15:41,981 --> 01:15:43,653
'I wanted revenge.'

925
01:15:44,168 --> 01:15:46,348
'I wanted to use their training
against them.'

926
01:15:48,161 --> 01:15:51,568
'Kaya, Mr Black and
their secret organisation.'

927
01:15:52,493 --> 01:15:54,708
'I wanted to destroy all of them.'

928
01:15:55,273 --> 01:15:56,578
'All of them.'

929
01:15:59,851 --> 01:16:00,903
Here's some wine for you, ma'am.

930
01:16:01,506 --> 01:16:03,403
It's vintage white,
you'll like it.

931
01:16:04,166 --> 01:16:05,650
Oh wow!

932
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:14,381
Thank you so much.
This is very kind. Thank you for it.

933
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:15,948
Such hard work.

934
01:16:19,945 --> 01:16:21,163
Will you excuse me for a second?

935
01:16:23,675 --> 01:16:25,491
And you are...
- Leena Singh.

936
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:27,641
I'm a very big fan of yours.

937
01:16:27,998 --> 01:16:29,341
My fan!

938
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:31,761
News anchors don't have fans.

939
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:33,126
Well, they do.

940
01:16:33,443 --> 01:16:36,478
Girls like me watch TV
for anchors like you.

941
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,495
Are you Indian?
- Yes.

942
01:16:42,036 --> 01:16:44,203
I'm glad you support this charity.

943
01:16:45,218 --> 01:16:46,900
I have to do charity
for this cause.

944
01:16:47,505 --> 01:16:50,573
But I want to do
some charity for you.

945
01:16:51,025 --> 01:16:52,413
For your career.

946
01:16:53,303 --> 01:16:54,381
I didn't get you.

947
01:16:54,696 --> 01:16:57,963
I have a major scoop every
journalist wants to have.

948
01:16:58,878 --> 01:17:01,061
Meet in room 503 of this hotel.

949
01:17:01,518 --> 01:17:03,985
I don't have much time.

950
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:06,061
Don't play this charity
drama over there.

951
01:17:07,183 --> 01:17:11,556
I know you don't give a damn
about anything except your career.

952
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:24,726
I don't believe this.

953
01:17:25,578 --> 01:17:27,056
Is this all true?

954
01:17:27,593 --> 01:17:29,601
This is sensational.

955
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,633
I told you.

956
01:17:36,281 --> 01:17:37,890
I'm a journalist.

957
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:42,821
So I know scoops like these
don't just fall into your lap.

958
01:17:46,681 --> 01:17:48,346
What's in it for you?

959
01:17:49,548 --> 01:17:51,873
Where is your phone?
- I have it. Why?

960
01:17:52,133 --> 01:17:53,425
Start recording.

961
01:17:53,633 --> 01:17:56,150
I'm ready to give
an on-camera confession.

962
01:17:56,850 --> 01:18:00,833
What do you mean?
- I can prove whatever I am saying.

963
01:18:01,725 --> 01:18:03,293
So come on now.

964
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:13,415
My name is Pari.

965
01:18:13,568 --> 01:18:16,226
I used to work for
a shadow organisation

966
01:18:16,778 --> 01:18:20,135
who was into stealing
and selling secrets.

967
01:18:20,483 --> 01:18:22,706
I've shared all
the information with Mike Khan

968
01:18:23,175 --> 01:18:25,826
which can used for exposing
this shadowy organisation.

969
01:18:30,328 --> 01:18:31,565
Is it okay now?

970
01:18:32,463 --> 01:18:34,138
Very good.
- Good.

971
01:18:35,273 --> 01:18:37,398
Now it's your turn.
-My turn.

972
01:18:37,726 --> 01:18:39,566
Even you can betray me

973
01:18:40,141 --> 01:18:41,986
by selling this scoop.

974
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:44,266
I also need a guarantee.

975
01:18:45,598 --> 01:18:47,381
What am I going to
confess on camera?

976
01:18:47,663 --> 01:18:49,671
If you betray me,

977
01:18:51,578 --> 01:18:54,896
then this sex tape will
reach your wife.

978
01:18:55,246 --> 01:18:56,678
Even if it doesn't
destroy your career,

979
01:18:57,175 --> 01:18:58,495
your marriage will fall apart.

980
01:18:58,793 --> 01:19:00,036
My sex tape?

981
01:19:01,311 --> 01:19:02,740
What are you saying?

982
01:19:03,026 --> 01:19:04,713
I don't have a sex tape.

983
01:19:11,796 --> 01:19:12,941
You'll have one now.

984
01:19:26,823 --> 01:19:31,241
"I'm alive in your eyes."

985
01:19:31,843 --> 01:19:36,103
"I'm the complaint on your lips."

986
01:19:36,680 --> 01:19:41,098
"I'm in your life."

987
01:19:41,551 --> 01:19:45,653
"I'll be there when I'm gone."

988
01:19:46,323 --> 01:19:50,628
"Whether you see me or not,"

989
01:19:51,276 --> 01:19:55,813
"I'm always with you."

990
01:19:56,153 --> 01:20:00,283
"Hide me in your heartbeat."

991
01:20:01,078 --> 01:20:05,073
"I'm your feeling."

992
01:20:05,338 --> 01:20:09,886
"I'll go wherever you go."

993
01:20:10,118 --> 01:20:15,043
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

994
01:20:15,213 --> 01:20:19,801
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

995
01:20:20,108 --> 01:20:24,631
"Oh my secret keeper!"

996
01:20:24,911 --> 01:20:29,276
"I'll go wherever you go."

997
01:20:29,496 --> 01:20:34,495
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

998
01:20:34,688 --> 01:20:39,203
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

999
01:20:39,468 --> 01:20:44,608
"Oh my secret keeper!"

1000
01:20:50,108 --> 01:20:52,506
'So as you've seen that
we have it from a strong source'

1001
01:20:52,596 --> 01:20:54,061
'that Aeronautics Avionics,'

1002
01:20:54,151 --> 01:20:56,781
'an English company
have sold missiles to Abu Hamza'

1003
01:20:56,871 --> 01:20:59,718
'at half the prize to beat
its Russian competitors.'

1004
01:21:00,026 --> 01:21:02,151
'that what they sold it
to the English government.'

1005
01:21:02,601 --> 01:21:05,431
'How can the English taxpayers
and government stand for this?'

1006
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:07,881
'We're already trying to get
at the bottom of this.'

1007
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:10,993
'The people whoever involved
will definitely be'

1008
01:21:11,083 --> 01:21:13,083
Tell them I'm not available.
- for such betrayal.'

1009
01:21:13,586 --> 01:21:16,028
'The British Government take it
very seriously.' - Kaya.

1010
01:21:17,898 --> 01:21:19,773
Abu Hamza is on his way here.

1011
01:21:19,863 --> 01:21:21,176
He is demanding a meeting.

1012
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:23,301
Now I strongly recommend
that you meet with him.

1013
01:21:23,391 --> 01:21:25,451
You can't possibly
turn down everyone.

1014
01:21:25,541 --> 01:21:27,330
I can and I will.

1015
01:21:27,850 --> 01:21:29,648
I'm not meeting anybody today.

1016
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:32,046
Do your job well
and make them go away.

1017
01:21:32,248 --> 01:21:34,161
Why the hell are you
not answering your phone?

1018
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:36,201
It's my bloody choice.

1019
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:39,091
I'll do as I please and
no one can stop me from doing so.

1020
01:21:39,181 --> 01:21:40,840
Try and explain
that to Mr Black.

1021
01:21:40,930 --> 01:21:42,578
He wants to see you now.

1022
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,126
That was a brilliant move, Pari.

1023
01:21:52,718 --> 01:21:53,586
Very nice.

1024
01:21:53,740 --> 01:21:56,431
You pushed Kaya on the back foot
in one go.

1025
01:21:57,316 --> 01:22:00,968
Now she must answer
the Parliament and media.

1026
01:22:01,808 --> 01:22:03,005
You should be proud of yourself.

1027
01:22:03,095 --> 01:22:04,986
Doctor, the medicine
that you gave me,

1028
01:22:05,393 --> 01:22:08,173
gives me frequent hallucinations.

1029
01:22:08,873 --> 01:22:10,046
I mean...

1030
01:22:10,616 --> 01:22:12,016
I feel as if...

1031
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,950
I see Kabir all the time.

1032
01:22:15,215 --> 01:22:16,473
I am really sorry.

1033
01:22:16,716 --> 01:22:21,128
I had no other quick way to
control your pain.

1034
01:22:21,901 --> 01:22:24,586
I had to give you
these strong painkillers.

1035
01:22:25,410 --> 01:22:26,961
It has opium in it.

1036
01:22:27,571 --> 01:22:30,426
So hallucinations
comes as a side effect.

1037
01:22:30,658 --> 01:22:32,401
To prevent one pain,

1038
01:22:33,236 --> 01:22:35,528
I must bear another pain.

1039
01:22:36,481 --> 01:22:38,536
To keep myself alive,

1040
01:22:40,106 --> 01:22:42,486
I must see Kabir dying
every now and then.

1041
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:44,896
I warned you not to spoil her.

1042
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:46,695
Did you see what happened?

1043
01:22:46,988 --> 01:22:49,905
Had you killed her before,
it wouldn't have come to this.

1044
01:22:50,101 --> 01:22:52,963
A moll has brought an organisation
to its knees.

1045
01:22:53,136 --> 01:22:57,481
During testing times, weak often
hurl accusations at each other.

1046
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:02,006
We'll face challenges while
running such a big organisation.

1047
01:23:02,578 --> 01:23:04,835
I can deal with these challenges.

1048
01:23:05,151 --> 01:23:08,153
But then I think,
what's your use?

1049
01:23:08,711 --> 01:23:11,661
Many girls are recruited for you,

1050
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:13,896
but you kill them
after a while.

1051
01:23:14,551 --> 01:23:17,023
This also causes a great loss
to our organisation.

1052
01:23:17,678 --> 01:23:21,283
You know it takes a huge investment

1053
01:23:21,628 --> 01:23:22,886
to turn a girl into an agent.

1054
01:23:23,681 --> 01:23:25,131
I get the feeling

1055
01:23:25,338 --> 01:23:28,188
that you can't handle
this responsibility anymore.

1056
01:23:29,153 --> 01:23:31,225
Mr Black,
Ms Pari is here to see you.

1057
01:23:31,478 --> 01:23:34,096
Rutherford, please take Kaya
to the next room

1058
01:23:34,363 --> 01:23:36,686
and make sure she stays there

1059
01:23:37,020 --> 01:23:39,163
till I finish my meeting with Pari.

1060
01:23:58,268 --> 01:23:59,685
I am impressed.

1061
01:24:00,153 --> 01:24:01,913
I hate backstabbers, but...

1062
01:24:02,135 --> 01:24:03,341
I like you.

1063
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:06,558
You have been charming
even when you're an enemy.

1064
01:24:06,813 --> 01:24:08,353
Give me Kaya

1065
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:11,260
and I'll spare your organisation.

1066
01:24:11,681 --> 01:24:13,448
If that doesn't happen,

1067
01:24:13,538 --> 01:24:17,003
I'll do whatever it takes
to reach Kaya.

1068
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:21,973
I've already leaked a few secrets
to show my intent.

1069
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:26,678
Before I do anything which sends
your organisation into disarray,

1070
01:24:27,158 --> 01:24:28,533
give me Kaya.

1071
01:24:28,623 --> 01:24:29,583
Oh!

1072
01:24:30,233 --> 01:24:32,586
You had just impressed me.

1073
01:24:33,048 --> 01:24:34,943
But now you do this.

1074
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:36,573
Very bad, Pari.

1075
01:24:37,213 --> 01:24:41,511
People who issue threats
can't do anything.

1076
01:24:42,001 --> 01:24:44,223
Clouds that rain,
don't bring thunder.

1077
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,405
I didn't come here
to threaten you, Mr Black.

1078
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:49,035
I am here to offer you a deal.

1079
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:52,441
Liabilities aren't good
for your business.

1080
01:24:53,245 --> 01:24:56,483
Right now, Kaya is a liability
for you.

1081
01:24:57,316 --> 01:24:58,980
You have two days.

1082
01:24:59,466 --> 01:25:01,511
offer valid till I change my mind.

1083
01:25:09,721 --> 01:25:11,210
Did you hear that?

1084
01:25:11,548 --> 01:25:13,298
You have two days

1085
01:25:13,488 --> 01:25:15,978
to become an asset
from a liability.

1086
01:25:16,451 --> 01:25:17,728
Or else

1087
01:25:18,043 --> 01:25:20,483
I'll accept Pari's offer.

1088
01:25:34,608 --> 01:25:36,458
Please tell me you found out
where Pari is hiding.

1089
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:39,968
Yes, ma'am. She's at
the Tower Bridge room 504.

1090
01:25:43,133 --> 01:25:44,425
Well done, Kristov.

1091
01:25:45,468 --> 01:25:46,956
Now go get her.

1092
01:25:47,986 --> 01:25:49,968
I'll be waiting outside the hotel.

1093
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:54,180
I need to see her body
hanging outside the hotel

1094
01:25:54,456 --> 01:25:56,183
for the whole world to see.

1095
01:25:56,783 --> 01:25:58,186
No problem, ma'am.

1096
01:25:58,681 --> 01:25:59,956
It should be fun.

1097
01:26:38,476 --> 01:26:41,263
I remember one of your tricks
so well.

1098
01:26:42,228 --> 01:26:43,661
Didn't you teach me,

1099
01:26:44,168 --> 01:26:45,805
it's not about the dog in the fight,

1100
01:26:46,490 --> 01:26:48,161
but the fight in the dog.

1101
01:26:49,368 --> 01:26:51,208
I've shot you with
a paralysing agent.

1102
01:26:51,491 --> 01:26:52,873
So no point trying to move.

1103
01:26:53,176 --> 01:26:56,061
You should've trusted your training
if not me.

1104
01:26:57,268 --> 01:27:00,421
Did you assume you'd
kill me so easily?

1105
01:27:00,780 --> 01:27:03,658
If I had my way,
you would've never found me.

1106
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:05,745
But I wanted you to find me.

1107
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:07,325
Would you like to see magic?

1108
01:27:10,020 --> 01:27:11,120
Look up.

1109
01:27:19,171 --> 01:27:22,638
Look at the poor guy
hanging between life and death.

1110
01:27:33,396 --> 01:27:36,611
If I call the hotel security
and say there's someone in my room,

1111
01:27:37,466 --> 01:27:38,743
they will rush in to help me.

1112
01:27:38,996 --> 01:27:41,176
Oh sorry, magic.

1113
01:27:41,501 --> 01:27:42,721
Yes.

1114
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:44,978
Three.

1115
01:27:48,385 --> 01:27:49,413
Two.

1116
01:27:53,065 --> 01:27:54,285
One.

1117
01:27:59,490 --> 01:28:02,536
Did you like it?
You waited for my death,

1118
01:28:03,058 --> 01:28:04,801
but it was Kristov who died.

1119
01:28:04,891 --> 01:28:06,275
And now...

1120
01:28:06,621 --> 01:28:07,996
you are next.

1121
01:29:18,798 --> 01:29:20,456
Now you'll say I'm not for real.

1122
01:29:22,713 --> 01:29:23,693
Right?

1123
01:29:24,701 --> 01:29:26,466
You know all my inner thoughts.

1124
01:29:28,038 --> 01:29:31,120
Because you're akin to a thought
which lives in my mind.

1125
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:33,293
I know you are not here.

1126
01:29:33,603 --> 01:29:35,198
I just can't convince myself.

1127
01:29:39,218 --> 01:29:40,791
Why do you fight yourself?

1128
01:29:42,913 --> 01:29:45,093
Why don't you accept
what you are feeling?

1129
01:29:46,566 --> 01:29:49,170
I saw you dying.

1130
01:29:52,655 --> 01:29:54,361
Feel me, Sonia.

1131
01:29:56,161 --> 01:29:58,185
If you can see me,

1132
01:29:59,716 --> 01:30:01,316
if you can hear me,

1133
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:05,153
and if you can feel my touch,

1134
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:09,773
then what prevents me
from being real?

1135
01:30:09,863 --> 01:30:18,911
"I'm right here, I just need a
bit of your faith to make me real."

1136
01:30:19,441 --> 01:30:28,635
"I just need a bit of place from you
so that I can descend down."

1137
01:30:29,086 --> 01:30:33,758
"I am a smoke, living on mercy."

1138
01:30:33,993 --> 01:30:38,383
"Turn me into your reality."

1139
01:30:38,746 --> 01:30:48,508
"I'm darkness, touch me
with your eyes, lend me your light."

1140
01:30:48,836 --> 01:30:53,446
"I'm always silent"

1141
01:30:53,536 --> 01:30:57,795
"But I am your voice."

1142
01:30:58,316 --> 01:31:03,130
"I know how to die,"

1143
01:31:03,368 --> 01:31:07,388
"but I also know how to live."

1144
01:31:07,618 --> 01:31:12,486
"I'll go wherever you go."

1145
01:31:12,576 --> 01:31:17,326
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

1146
01:31:17,416 --> 01:31:22,176
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

1147
01:31:22,345 --> 01:31:26,903
"Oh my secret keeper!"

1148
01:31:27,168 --> 01:31:31,938
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

1149
01:31:32,168 --> 01:31:36,736
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

1150
01:31:36,826 --> 01:31:41,541
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

1151
01:31:41,743 --> 01:31:46,980
"Oh my secret keeper!"

1152
01:32:04,763 --> 01:32:06,703
Kabir, I can't handle this!

1153
01:32:06,886 --> 01:32:09,855
'Every day I see you alive
and then I find you dead.'

1154
01:32:10,068 --> 01:32:12,998
'These medicines won't
keep me alive, they'll kill me.'

1155
01:32:19,550 --> 01:32:23,500
'Misfortune refuses to end for
the Khannas from Southall.'

1156
01:32:23,686 --> 01:32:26,565
'One of the sisters was jailed
for a murder and drug running'

1157
01:32:26,711 --> 01:32:29,126
'and now this shocking incident.
See the report.'

1158
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:30,678
'I was very scared.'

1159
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:34,145
'A few men drove here
at midnight'

1160
01:32:34,405 --> 01:32:35,895
'and they beat the hell out of her.'

1161
01:32:35,985 --> 01:32:39,235
'They said she had 24 hours,'

1162
01:32:39,438 --> 01:32:41,758
'or else she'd disappear
like her sister.'

1163
01:32:42,126 --> 01:32:44,303
'They left soon after
saying this.'

1164
01:32:44,393 --> 01:32:46,251
'The victim is Preet Khanna.'

1165
01:32:46,341 --> 01:32:49,133
'She is Sonia Khanna's sister
who died in prison.'

1166
01:32:49,223 --> 01:32:52,775
'Right now, Preet Khanna is fighting
for her life in City Hospital.'

1167
01:32:52,928 --> 01:32:56,105
'The police believe that a big
organisation is behind this attack.'

1168
01:33:01,291 --> 01:33:02,391
Excuse me.
- Yeah.

1169
01:33:02,573 --> 01:33:03,893
Have you seen this girl?
- Not really.

1170
01:33:04,276 --> 01:33:05,530
It's likely she'll be here.

1171
01:33:05,845 --> 01:33:08,271
If you spot this girl,
call me on this number.

1172
01:33:09,428 --> 01:33:11,031
Make sure.
- Sure.

1173
01:33:13,718 --> 01:33:15,278
Who are they?

1174
01:33:16,061 --> 01:33:18,276
What harm did my daughter
do to them?

1175
01:33:19,911 --> 01:33:21,401
I also don't understand that, aunt.

1176
01:33:21,748 --> 01:33:23,735
But they were asking about Sonia.

1177
01:33:24,986 --> 01:33:27,515
Maybe they were looking for Sonia.

1178
01:33:27,983 --> 01:33:29,540
It was Preet who suffered.

1179
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:32,068
Doctor! Doctor!

1180
01:33:34,646 --> 01:33:36,560
Preet! Preet!
- Please, please.

1181
01:33:36,650 --> 01:33:37,936
Please step out.

1182
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:39,325
Injection, please.

1183
01:33:43,088 --> 01:33:44,966
One, two, three.

1184
01:33:45,988 --> 01:33:47,778
One, two, three.

1185
01:33:49,865 --> 01:33:51,405
Two, three.

1186
01:33:54,836 --> 01:33:57,185
Time of death: 1:55 pm.

1187
01:34:00,226 --> 01:34:01,388
We tried our best,

1188
01:34:01,558 --> 01:34:02,918
but we couldn't save your daughter.

1189
01:34:03,436 --> 01:34:04,645
I am so sorry.

1190
01:34:09,536 --> 01:34:11,053
I just don't understand

1191
01:34:11,990 --> 01:34:15,093
why we are being punished.

1192
01:34:16,271 --> 01:34:18,168
There can't be anyone
more unfortunate than us.

1193
01:34:19,196 --> 01:34:21,058
One daughter left us before.

1194
01:34:21,278 --> 01:34:22,655
And now we lost another.

1195
01:34:34,930 --> 01:34:37,103
Excuse me.
- Yes, madam?

1196
01:34:38,088 --> 01:34:39,466
I need this pill.

1197
01:34:39,668 --> 01:34:40,956
Okay, madam. Just wait here.

1198
01:35:01,123 --> 01:35:05,326
'Kaya made it clear
that no one was safe in this war.'

1199
01:35:05,946 --> 01:35:08,475
'First Kabir
and now my sister.'

1200
01:35:08,685 --> 01:35:10,316
'The next victim
could've been anyone.'

1201
01:35:10,593 --> 01:35:12,473
'Mom, Dad. Anyone.'

1202
01:35:13,081 --> 01:35:14,865
'I had only one chance.'

1203
01:35:15,475 --> 01:35:17,145
'I had only last move left.'

1204
01:35:17,643 --> 01:35:19,911
'A move that would'

1205
01:35:20,621 --> 01:35:22,361
'neutralise all my enemies.'

1206
01:36:13,558 --> 01:36:16,323
Soaib. - You and your force
are looking for me.

1207
01:36:17,318 --> 01:36:19,083
My name is Sonia Khanna.

1208
01:36:19,558 --> 01:36:20,788
AKA Pari.

1209
01:36:23,078 --> 01:36:26,566
Meet me if you want to
crack this big case.

1210
01:36:27,176 --> 01:36:28,570
What do you want in return?

1211
01:36:36,645 --> 01:36:37,491
Thank you.

1212
01:36:37,581 --> 01:36:41,041
So madam, you knew
I'd make you pay for this.

1213
01:36:41,426 --> 01:36:44,128
I could've arrested you
if I wanted to.

1214
01:36:44,856 --> 01:36:48,411
If you wanted to, you
would've brought the police force.

1215
01:36:49,338 --> 01:36:51,585
You know your brother is
a part of this racket.

1216
01:36:52,221 --> 01:36:55,133
If I am caught,
he'd be exposed.

1217
01:36:55,545 --> 01:36:58,366
There can be two reasons why
you're doing a solo investigation.

1218
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:00,731
Either you are corrupt

1219
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:02,165
or helpless.

1220
01:37:03,123 --> 01:37:04,930
Smart, very smart.

1221
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:06,606
If you are not helpless

1222
01:37:06,841 --> 01:37:09,376
and want something in return
for the package you gave me,

1223
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,655
then you must expose this racket.

1224
01:37:12,971 --> 01:37:16,148
Tonight, you must reach
the tunnel via the canal.

1225
01:37:16,293 --> 01:37:17,665
Tunnel?

1226
01:37:18,838 --> 01:37:20,908
Canal?
- I'll tell you about the palace

1227
01:37:21,286 --> 01:37:23,081
you've been looking for a while.

1228
01:37:23,403 --> 01:37:26,823
As for me, thank you for these
photographs and address.

1229
01:37:45,931 --> 01:37:47,178
Hello.

1230
01:38:23,406 --> 01:38:24,473
Sorry, Soaib.

1231
01:38:24,936 --> 01:38:26,653
I hate doing this.

1232
01:38:26,968 --> 01:38:28,843
Foot soldiers are often sacrificed

1233
01:38:29,323 --> 01:38:31,620
in major wars.

1234
01:38:43,756 --> 01:38:46,755
Hello. Is that Metropolitan Police?

1235
01:38:48,316 --> 01:38:49,761
I have a murder to report

1236
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,398
in a town house outside London.

1237
01:38:56,066 --> 01:38:57,716
Kaya!

1238
01:38:58,066 --> 01:39:01,956
I knew Pari would come crawling
to me to save her last sister.

1239
01:39:02,133 --> 01:39:05,236
Right? - We have a problem,
you have to come with me.

1240
01:39:08,728 --> 01:39:10,025
Look.

1241
01:39:11,348 --> 01:39:12,785
What the hell?

1242
01:39:23,911 --> 01:39:25,040
She did it.

1243
01:39:25,871 --> 01:39:28,643
That bloody b**ch!
Pari has done this.

1244
01:39:29,061 --> 01:39:32,418
She exposed our racket
just like that. - What?

1245
01:39:33,286 --> 01:39:36,340
How? - She knew he was
Inspector Javed's brother.

1246
01:39:37,780 --> 01:39:39,550
So she killed him here.

1247
01:39:39,888 --> 01:39:41,955
I'm sure, she informed the police
after killing him.

1248
01:39:42,816 --> 01:39:46,116
The police will barge in here
any minute looking for him.

1249
01:39:46,343 --> 01:39:49,298
We can hide this dead body
somewhere else.

1250
01:39:49,388 --> 01:39:50,808
It's too late.

1251
01:39:51,196 --> 01:39:52,578
It's too bloody late.

1252
01:40:03,961 --> 01:40:05,108
Damn it!

1253
01:40:05,381 --> 01:40:06,526
S**t has hit the roof.

1254
01:40:42,986 --> 01:40:44,431
Kaya, you shouldn't have done it.

1255
01:40:44,521 --> 01:40:46,158
You shouldn't have
killed my brother.

1256
01:40:46,351 --> 01:40:48,275
Get out of
this bloody car, Kaya!

1257
01:40:48,546 --> 01:40:50,471
Get out now! Kaya!

1258
01:41:04,516 --> 01:41:06,711
Sorry, sir. It's a crime scene,
you can't go through.

1259
01:41:06,926 --> 01:41:08,913
We have information
that a cop is missing.

1260
01:41:09,161 --> 01:41:10,928
I'm going to leak
this story anyway.

1261
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,806
You can keep me in or out.

1262
01:41:15,193 --> 01:41:16,316
We have the press over here.

1263
01:41:16,593 --> 01:41:18,451
'A policeman's dead body
has been found in a barn'

1264
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:20,430
'in the outskirts
of London this morning.'

1265
01:41:20,635 --> 01:41:21,641
'The barn has a tunnel'

1266
01:41:21,731 --> 01:41:24,106
'that leads to a facility
where the girls are being trained'

1267
01:41:24,293 --> 01:41:26,628
'in secret to become
espionage agent.'

1268
01:41:29,928 --> 01:41:31,783
'Ms Kaya is here
to see Mr Black, sir.'

1269
01:41:31,988 --> 01:41:33,540
Tell her Mr Black
isn't seeing anyone.

1270
01:41:34,328 --> 01:41:36,593
He has other problems
to take care of.

1271
01:41:38,483 --> 01:41:40,261
That b***h has screwed us all.

1272
01:41:40,351 --> 01:41:42,386
I need to speak
to Mr Black right now.

1273
01:41:42,476 --> 01:41:43,908
She has turned the police against us

1274
01:41:43,998 --> 01:41:45,036
by killing Javed's brother.

1275
01:41:45,126 --> 01:41:46,258
Javed is out for revenge.

1276
01:41:46,348 --> 01:41:48,571
The media is creating a circus.
We are f***ked!

1277
01:41:48,805 --> 01:41:50,321
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

1278
01:41:53,748 --> 01:41:55,173
I think you should leave.

1279
01:41:56,725 --> 01:41:57,833
What?

1280
01:41:58,545 --> 01:41:59,935
You don't know who I am.

1281
01:42:01,183 --> 01:42:03,708
You f**king b****d.

1282
01:42:04,465 --> 01:42:06,976
If I go down,
I'm going to take you down with me.

1283
01:42:07,351 --> 01:42:08,630
I'm gonna have to call the police

1284
01:42:08,720 --> 01:42:10,456
if you don't leave
immediately, Miss.

1285
01:42:15,471 --> 01:42:18,935
When you get angry,
you can't think straight.

1286
01:42:19,568 --> 01:42:20,478
What do you mean?

1287
01:42:20,626 --> 01:42:22,355
Did you ever think

1288
01:42:22,551 --> 01:42:25,070
why Mr Black spared Pari

1289
01:42:25,641 --> 01:42:27,955
despite she made a huge mistake?

1290
01:42:30,316 --> 01:42:33,865
Because Mr Black is using Pari
against you.

1291
01:42:35,750 --> 01:42:37,605
Pari is Mr Black's weapon.

1292
01:42:39,770 --> 01:42:42,456
He can't do anything
and always remains in shadows.

1293
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:45,511
So he is using your enemy
against you.

1294
01:42:46,006 --> 01:42:48,453
If you want to get Mr Black,

1295
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:51,196
you have to get rid of Pari.

1296
01:42:51,521 --> 01:42:55,393
Maybe Mr Black sent you
to confuse me,

1297
01:42:56,445 --> 01:42:58,801
so that I'd target Pari
instead of him.

1298
01:43:01,326 --> 01:43:03,476
It's possible,
but it's not the case.

1299
01:43:05,120 --> 01:43:07,108
Like I just told you.

1300
01:43:09,713 --> 01:43:12,096
You aren't thinking this through.

1301
01:43:12,548 --> 01:43:14,431
Why are you helping me?

1302
01:43:15,455 --> 01:43:18,756
You may assume
that I must kill Mr Black.

1303
01:43:20,011 --> 01:43:22,176
If Pari has to die for this

1304
01:43:23,178 --> 01:43:24,356
then so be it.

1305
01:43:25,408 --> 01:43:26,536
I see.

1306
01:43:27,438 --> 01:43:28,503
I'm glad you do.

1307
01:43:28,651 --> 01:43:30,986
Now if you want
I can tell you

1308
01:43:31,953 --> 01:43:33,731
where Pari is right now.

1309
01:44:10,428 --> 01:44:13,316
I wish you wouldn't have
brought me at this juncture.

1310
01:44:13,878 --> 01:44:17,045
I made you Pari,
I gave you a new life.

1311
01:44:18,508 --> 01:44:21,841
Now I must take your life.

1312
01:44:22,201 --> 01:44:24,115
That's what you don't
understand, Kaya.

1313
01:44:25,235 --> 01:44:27,218
You didn't offer Pari any life.

1314
01:44:28,216 --> 01:44:30,155
Pari was born after someone died.

1315
01:44:30,481 --> 01:44:34,661
You can't kill someone twice.

1316
01:45:00,091 --> 01:45:02,061
Kids grow strong, but they can

1317
01:45:02,151 --> 01:45:03,793
never match their Mom.

1318
01:45:56,301 --> 01:45:57,393
Today, I've realised

1319
01:45:57,866 --> 01:45:59,786
that there's something
called karma.

1320
01:45:59,876 --> 01:46:03,560
You suffocated so many lives,
but today, you're suffocating.

1321
01:46:03,723 --> 01:46:07,250
Now just see how it feels
to be confined.

1322
01:46:07,440 --> 01:46:09,401
How it feels not to be
able to breathe?

1323
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:12,865
You want to scream, but you can't.
How does it feel?

1324
01:46:13,175 --> 01:46:14,563
Feel it!

1325
01:46:14,796 --> 01:46:16,468
You try to run away from death,

1326
01:46:16,558 --> 01:46:19,706
but death lurks behind you.
See how that feels.

1327
01:46:19,973 --> 01:46:21,596
Feel it, Kaya.

1328
01:46:33,970 --> 01:46:35,436
What have you done, Pari?

1329
01:46:35,613 --> 01:46:37,475
How did she find out
you are here?

1330
01:46:38,588 --> 01:46:40,113
There are many
who could tell her the address.

1331
01:46:42,011 --> 01:46:43,386
You can say

1332
01:46:44,336 --> 01:46:46,403
that I wanted to let her know
my address.

1333
01:46:46,861 --> 01:46:48,936
Some are ambush predators

1334
01:46:49,706 --> 01:46:51,053
and some attack openly.

1335
01:46:51,236 --> 01:46:52,830
You want to take Kaya's place?

1336
01:46:52,920 --> 01:46:54,685
I don't want to
take anyone's place.

1337
01:46:55,878 --> 01:46:58,176
I want to move them
from their place.

1338
01:47:00,208 --> 01:47:03,538
Now it's the turn of
our common enemy.

1339
01:47:05,421 --> 01:47:06,626
Mr Black.

1340
01:47:07,255 --> 01:47:08,263
Pari.

1341
01:47:09,411 --> 01:47:11,231
It's not easy to kill Mr Black.

1342
01:47:12,586 --> 01:47:13,700
Forget killing him,

1343
01:47:14,483 --> 01:47:16,698
it's not easy to reach him.

1344
01:47:17,226 --> 01:47:19,038
I've made it till here, Doctor.

1345
01:47:20,231 --> 01:47:23,765
Now either my luck will help me
as it always has

1346
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:27,390
or I'll die and go to Kabir.

1347
01:47:37,983 --> 01:47:39,101
I can't believe this.

1348
01:47:39,863 --> 01:47:41,381
Are you sure Kaya is dead?

1349
01:47:41,533 --> 01:47:42,458
Yes.

1350
01:47:43,101 --> 01:47:44,790
I saw it with my own eyes.

1351
01:47:45,326 --> 01:47:47,623
Pari is more dangerous than
we thought she is.

1352
01:47:47,893 --> 01:47:49,761
And now she is coming for Mr Black.

1353
01:47:50,128 --> 01:47:52,398
You must protect him
at any cost.

1354
01:47:52,641 --> 01:47:54,751
The doctor has informed me
that Pari has gone rogue.

1355
01:47:55,090 --> 01:47:57,111
She has killed Kaya
and now she's after Mr Black.

1356
01:47:57,278 --> 01:47:58,768
You need to keep Mr Black safe.

1357
01:47:58,858 --> 01:48:01,748
We'll make sure Mr Black
is protected at any cost.

1358
01:48:02,351 --> 01:48:04,705
Man all the doors,
keep an eye on all the CCTVs.

1359
01:48:04,878 --> 01:48:06,408
Check in every few minutes
on the radio.

1360
01:48:06,498 --> 01:48:08,671
Do you everything necessary.

1361
01:48:25,043 --> 01:48:26,271
Oh my God!

1362
01:48:27,835 --> 01:48:30,510
I told you,
Kaya didn't kill your brother.

1363
01:48:30,770 --> 01:48:32,146
Look at this.

1364
01:48:32,236 --> 01:48:33,648
What proof do you want?

1365
01:48:33,885 --> 01:48:35,550
How could a girl do it on her own?

1366
01:48:35,815 --> 01:48:37,298
Pari works alone

1367
01:48:37,745 --> 01:48:39,320
but she is the most dangerous.

1368
01:48:40,273 --> 01:48:41,933
She alone can match hundred killers.

1369
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:44,986
You can catch her
if you listen to me.

1370
01:48:45,230 --> 01:48:46,183
What do you mean?

1371
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,203
After killing Kaya, she'll
try to kill Mr Black.

1372
01:48:49,818 --> 01:48:52,018
She'll be where Mr Black is.

1373
01:50:23,981 --> 01:50:25,131
Mr Rutherford.

1374
01:50:26,586 --> 01:50:28,643
Won't you take me
to Mr Black now?

1375
01:51:13,356 --> 01:51:14,531
Everyone said

1376
01:51:15,361 --> 01:51:17,155
no one has seen Mr Black.

1377
01:51:18,678 --> 01:51:20,213
No one knows him.

1378
01:51:21,465 --> 01:51:23,981
But I had recognised you long ago.

1379
01:51:25,131 --> 01:51:27,078
I also found out about your ploy.

1380
01:51:34,448 --> 01:51:36,501
You made only one mistake.

1381
01:51:36,943 --> 01:51:39,158
'Clouds that rain,
don't bring thunder.'

1382
01:51:39,356 --> 01:51:41,451
'Clouds that rain,
don't bring thunder.'

1383
01:51:42,078 --> 01:51:44,118
You used the wrong phrase both
the times.

1384
01:51:44,696 --> 01:51:47,186
You should've said, clouds that
bring thunder don't rain.

1385
01:51:47,723 --> 01:51:49,928
But you said, clouds that rain,
don't bring thunder.

1386
01:51:51,365 --> 01:51:54,828
Two different people
can't make the same mistake.

1387
01:51:56,351 --> 01:51:57,606
So I understood

1388
01:51:58,091 --> 01:51:59,988
that you were using me

1389
01:52:00,771 --> 01:52:02,670
for getting rid of Kaya .

1390
01:52:03,085 --> 01:52:05,560
Kaya knew all your secrets.

1391
01:52:05,918 --> 01:52:07,703
She became a danger for you.

1392
01:52:08,071 --> 01:52:10,010
You sent photos to Kaya.

1393
01:52:10,616 --> 01:52:13,361
Because you knew she'd kill Kabir

1394
01:52:13,848 --> 01:52:15,025
and then I'd kill her.

1395
01:52:16,336 --> 01:52:20,695
Pari, to see you here now

1396
01:52:22,276 --> 01:52:24,173
makes me so proud of myself.

1397
01:52:24,758 --> 01:52:25,845
I knew I was right.

1398
01:52:26,473 --> 01:52:28,468
I knew you'd be the best.

1399
01:52:29,463 --> 01:52:30,733
And you are the best.

1400
01:52:30,908 --> 01:52:32,736
Then you must knew

1401
01:52:33,398 --> 01:52:35,576
I'd reach you.

1402
01:52:35,943 --> 01:52:38,658
The way you killed Kabir,

1403
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:41,776
I'd also kill you.

1404
01:52:42,751 --> 01:52:45,783
So are you ready to die, doctor?

1405
01:52:45,966 --> 01:52:48,188
I've been ready for years.

1406
01:52:49,203 --> 01:52:51,426
But there is a twist in the tale.

1407
01:52:52,561 --> 01:52:53,688
You see.

1408
01:52:56,185 --> 01:52:57,651
Right on time.

1409
01:52:58,413 --> 01:52:59,606
Look behind you.

1410
01:53:03,513 --> 01:53:04,635
The police are here.

1411
01:53:06,483 --> 01:53:09,636
If you kill me,
you won't be able to save yourself.

1412
01:53:11,660 --> 01:53:12,986
I'm also ready to die.

1413
01:53:13,233 --> 01:53:14,508
I don't want to kill you.

1414
01:53:15,673 --> 01:53:17,225
You'll be sent to jail.

1415
01:53:18,305 --> 01:53:19,990
I know you aren't afraid of death.

1416
01:53:20,308 --> 01:53:22,381
But I also know

1417
01:53:22,471 --> 01:53:26,013
you are afraid to be confined
inside the four walls.

1418
01:53:27,346 --> 01:53:29,073
You aren't afraid of death,

1419
01:53:29,426 --> 01:53:30,773
but you're afraid of
a living hell.

1420
01:53:30,998 --> 01:53:32,791
Now you have two choices.

1421
01:53:34,330 --> 01:53:37,616
Either, take the exit
through this door.

1422
01:53:38,483 --> 01:53:39,506
Or else.

1423
01:53:40,170 --> 01:53:41,785
kill me and go to jail.

1424
01:53:42,165 --> 01:53:43,555
The choice is yours.

1425
01:53:45,628 --> 01:53:46,750
Come on.

1426
01:53:47,815 --> 01:53:49,881
Come on. Come on, Pari.
The police are on their way, hurry.

1427
01:53:52,941 --> 01:53:54,663
Come on, Pari. Don't think.

1428
01:53:55,305 --> 01:53:56,765
Will you run away or get caught?

1429
01:53:59,903 --> 01:54:01,103
Rutherford.

1430
01:54:01,843 --> 01:54:04,283
I think you should open the door
and let the police come in.

1431
01:54:27,286 --> 01:54:28,866
Nice move, Rutherford.

1432
01:54:30,673 --> 01:54:32,841
Not a nice move,
but a helpless move.

1433
01:54:41,146 --> 01:54:42,125
Hello.

1434
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:50,271
Do you want to go back to jail?

1435
01:54:50,680 --> 01:54:52,358
Or do you want to be
the new Mr Black?

1436
01:54:52,618 --> 01:54:53,550
So.

1437
01:54:54,445 --> 01:54:55,686
Checkmate.

1438
01:54:59,501 --> 01:55:00,870
Open the door.

1439
01:55:01,321 --> 01:55:02,343
Quickly now.
- Open it!

1440
01:55:02,781 --> 01:55:04,156
We don't have much time.

1441
01:55:05,186 --> 01:55:06,456
Quickly!

1442
01:55:11,851 --> 01:55:13,036
Freeze! Don't move!

1443
01:55:16,816 --> 01:55:17,673
This is the man

1444
01:55:18,458 --> 01:55:19,695
who killed everyone.

1445
01:55:19,836 --> 01:55:20,738
Kaya.

1446
01:55:21,038 --> 01:55:22,313
Your brother Soaib.

1447
01:55:22,978 --> 01:55:24,451
If it wasn't for this brave,
young woman,

1448
01:55:24,648 --> 01:55:25,933
I'll be dead too.

1449
01:55:38,808 --> 01:55:40,218
Mr Rutherford.

1450
01:55:44,146 --> 01:55:47,046
Or should I say the new Mr Black?

1451
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:50,303
The deal between you and me
was that I help you become Mr Black

1452
01:55:50,838 --> 01:55:52,340
and you never get in
touch with me.

1453
01:55:52,926 --> 01:55:54,241
Or see me ever again.

1454
01:55:54,518 --> 01:55:55,720
I know that, Pari.

1455
01:55:56,116 --> 01:55:57,396
I remember.

1456
01:55:57,571 --> 01:55:59,246
But there is something for
which I had to see you.

1457
01:55:59,336 --> 01:56:00,543
Only you can do this.

1458
01:56:01,065 --> 01:56:02,763
What is it?
- This

1459
01:56:04,196 --> 01:56:05,173
is Fidel Lanzov.

1460
01:56:05,403 --> 01:56:06,826
A Spanish millionaire.

1461
01:56:12,193 --> 01:56:13,570
I don't care who this is.

1462
01:56:13,901 --> 01:56:14,743
I am out of this game.

1463
01:56:14,883 --> 01:56:16,401
I know that, Pari. But please.

1464
01:56:17,281 --> 01:56:18,325
Listen.

1465
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:19,628
It's not what you think.

1466
01:56:19,718 --> 01:56:21,621
You thought you could get out

1467
01:56:21,998 --> 01:56:23,291
that you could go away.

1468
01:56:24,955 --> 01:56:26,281
But they won't leave you.

1469
01:56:28,031 --> 01:56:29,773
In pictures, you see
Fatima al-Riyadhi.

1470
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:32,521
She is an Arab girl.

1471
01:56:32,673 --> 01:56:34,321
They too fell in love
like us.

1472
01:56:36,421 --> 01:56:38,628
They dreamed of living together.

1473
01:56:39,293 --> 01:56:41,223
And then they were separated
like us.

1474
01:56:43,656 --> 01:56:45,771
In her country, girls
aren't allowed to fall in love.

1475
01:56:47,713 --> 01:56:48,778
Bring her back.

1476
01:56:49,321 --> 01:56:50,483
Fidel knows

1477
01:56:50,861 --> 01:56:53,723
only you can bring his
Fatima back.

1478
01:56:54,748 --> 01:56:56,053
The best in the business.

1479
01:56:56,143 --> 01:56:58,563
Please, Pari.
You can do this.

1480
01:56:59,021 --> 01:57:00,673
Only you can do this.

1481
01:57:00,978 --> 01:57:02,485
This isn't for money.

1482
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,143
This is for love.

1483
01:57:04,618 --> 01:57:06,650
'That day I realised the truth.'

1484
01:57:07,501 --> 01:57:10,430
'I escaped one prison
only to enter another.'

1485
01:57:12,545 --> 01:57:14,056
'As long as we are alive,'

1486
01:57:14,260 --> 01:57:16,228
'we'll always be confined.'

1487
01:57:16,506 --> 01:57:18,943
'As long as
our soul is inside our body,'

1488
01:57:19,243 --> 01:57:21,403
'we'll be prisoners.'

1489
01:57:21,996 --> 01:57:23,801
'Only death can free us.'

1490
01:57:24,231 --> 01:57:25,811
'Since we have to live in prison,'

1491
01:57:26,330 --> 01:57:29,558
'I'd choose prison of love
over hate.'

1492
01:57:29,885 --> 01:57:34,703
"I'll go wherever you go."

1493
01:57:34,946 --> 01:57:39,531
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

1494
01:57:39,741 --> 01:57:44,403
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

1495
01:57:44,646 --> 01:57:49,066
"Oh my secret keeper!"

1496
01:57:49,371 --> 01:57:54,301
"I'll go wherever you go."

1497
01:57:54,511 --> 01:57:59,061
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

1498
01:57:59,291 --> 01:58:03,858
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

1499
01:58:04,088 --> 01:58:08,805
"Oh my secret keeper!"

1500
01:58:28,951 --> 01:58:33,535
"When a gentle breeze caresses you,"

1501
01:58:33,625 --> 01:58:38,198
"you'll feel my touch."

1502
01:58:38,561 --> 01:58:43,313
"When you see your face
in the mirror,"

1503
01:58:43,553 --> 01:58:47,925
"you'll find my reflection
in your face."

1504
01:58:48,251 --> 01:58:57,545
"At dawn, I flow through your tears
as morning."

1505
01:58:57,863 --> 01:59:02,676
"I was with you, I still am"

1506
01:59:02,853 --> 01:59:07,216
"I am not away from you."

1507
01:59:07,733 --> 01:59:12,283
"This life might change"

1508
01:59:12,715 --> 01:59:16,946
"I'm in every shade of it."

1509
01:59:17,398 --> 01:59:21,823
"Like an unseen shadow,"

1510
01:59:22,413 --> 01:59:26,443
"I follow you in the sun."

1511
01:59:26,823 --> 01:59:31,503
"I'll go wherever you go."

1512
01:59:31,741 --> 01:59:36,380
"I'll drown in you
and then I'll float again."

1513
01:59:36,636 --> 01:59:41,265
"I'm your love,
how can I ever die?"

1514
01:59:41,563 --> 01:59:46,995
"Oh my secret keeper!"

9999
